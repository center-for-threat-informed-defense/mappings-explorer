Virtualization technologies provide a layer of isolation and containment to isolate and contain the impact of potential compromises.  For the Escape to Host technique, Consider utilizing seccomp, seccomp-bpf, or a similar solution that restricts certain system calls such as mount. In Kubernetes environments, consider defining Pod Security Standards that limit container access to host process namespaces, the host network, and the host file system.",

Virtualization technologies provide a layer of isolation and containment to isolate and contain the impact of potential compromises. When it comes to the Drive-By-Compromise, browser sandboxes can be used to mitigate some of the impact of exploitation, but sandbox escapes may still exist. Other types of virtualization and application micro-segmentation may also mitigate the impact of client-side exploitation. The risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in implementation may still exist for these types of systems.",
