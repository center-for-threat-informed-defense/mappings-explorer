Adversaries may carry out malicious operations using a virtual instance to avoid detection. After running a virtual instance, adversaries may create a shared folder between the guest and host with permissions that enable the virtual instance to interact with the host file system. To aid in mitigating this technique, consider using application control mechanisms to mitigate installation and use of unapproved virtualization software, shared folders not necessary within a given environment, and periodically audit virtual machines for abnormalities.",
