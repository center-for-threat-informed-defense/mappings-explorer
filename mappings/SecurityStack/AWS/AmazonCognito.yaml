          This control provides partial protection for one of this technique's sub-techniques and
          a few of its procedure examples resulting in an overall Minimal protection score.

            comments: >-
              Amazon Cognito has the ability to alert and block accounts where credentials were
              found to be compromised elsewhere (compromised credential protection). The service also
              detects unusual sign-in activity, such as sign-in attempts from new locations and devices
              and can either prompt users for additional verification or block the sign-in request.  There
              was insufficient detail on the operation of these capabilities and therefore a conservative
              assessment of a Partial score has been assigned.

          Amazon Cognito's MFA capability provides significant protection against password compromises, requiring
          the adversary to complete an additional authentication method before their access is permitted.

              MFA can significantly reduce the impact of a password compromise, requiring the
              adversary to complete an additional authentication method before their access is permitted.
