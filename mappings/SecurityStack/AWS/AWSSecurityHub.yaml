  AWS Security Hub is a tool that supports the aggregation, organization, and prioritization of
  security alerts and findings from multiple services including Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector,
  Amazon Macie, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer, AWS Systems Manager, AWS
  Firewall Manager, and AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions. To do this, AWS Security Hub relies on
  managed insights which are collections of findings that identify security areas that need to be
  addressed as well as custom checks for different detections. While AWS Security Hub supports 
  custom insights and numerous AWS Config checks, this mapping focuses only on the managed insights 
  and the custom Security Hub checks provided by Amazon. Custom managed insights and AWS Config checks
  are considered out of scope for this mapping as the custom managed insights will vary from organization 
  to organization and AWS Config has its own mapping.

          AWS Security Hub detects improperly secured data from S3 buckets such as public read and
          write access that may result in an adversary getting access to data in cloud storage. AWS
          Security Hub provides this detection with the following managed insight.

          S3 buckets with public write or read permissions

          AWS Security Hub also performs checks from the AWS Foundations CIS Benchmark that, if
          implemented, would help towards detecting improperly secured S3 buckets which could result
          in them being discovered. AWS Security Hub provides this detection with the following
          check.

          3.8 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for S3 bucket policy changes 

          This is scored as Partial because it only detects when S3 buckets have public read or write access 
          and doesn't detect improperly secured data in other storage types (e.g., DBs, NFS, etc.).

          about cloud infrastructure used by the organization. AWS Security Hub provides these detections

          S3 buckets with public write or read permissions
          EC2 instances that have ports accessible from the Internet
          EC2 instances that are open to the Internet

          AWS Security Hub also performs checks from the AWS Foundations CIS Benchmark that, if

          in them being discovered. AWS Security Hub provides this detection with the following
          check.

          3.8 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for S3 bucket policy changes 

          This is scored as Partial because S3 and EC2 only represent a subset of available cloud
          infrastructure components.

          AWS Security Hub detects suspicious activity by AWS accounts which could indicate valid
          accounts being leveraged by an adversary. AWS Security Hub provides these detections with
          the following managed insights.

          AWS principals with suspicious access key activity
          Credentials that may have leaked
          AWS resources with unauthorized access attempts
          IAM users with suspicious activity

          AWS Security Hub also performs checks from the AWS Foundations CIS Benchmark and PCI-DSS security 
          standard that, if implemented, would help towards detecting the misuse of valid accounts. AWS 
          Security Hub provides these detections with the following checks.

          3.1 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for unauthorized API calls
          3.2 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for Management Console sign-in without MFA
          3.3 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for usage of "root" account 
          3.4 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for IAM policy changes
          3.6 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for AWS Management Console authentication failures
          [PCI.CW.1] A log metric filter and alarm should exist for usage of the "root" user

          By monitoring the root account, activity where accounts make unauthorized API calls, and
          changes to IAM permissions among other things, it may be possible to detect valid accounts that 
          are being misused and are potentially compromised.

          This is scored as Minimal because it only supports a subset of the sub-techniques (1 of

              This is scored as Significant because it can detect when changes are made to key AWS
              services (e.g., CloudTrail, Config, etc.) such as when they stop logging or other
              configuration changes are made.

          AWS Security Hub performs a check from the AWS Foundations CIS Benchmark that, if
          implemented, would help towards detecting the brute forcing of accounts. AWS Security Hub
          provides this detection with the following checks.

          3.6 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for AWS Management Console authentication failures

          This is scored as Minimal because it only applies to the AWS Management Console and not other access
          mechanisms (e.g., CLI, SDK, etc.) and it only supports a subset of the sub-techniques (3 of 4). Furthermore,
          it does not detect brute-forcing methods for other components such as EC2 instances.

          AWS Security Hub performs a check from the AWS Foundations CIS Benchmark that, if
          implemented, would help towards detecting the scheduled destruction of Customer Master
          Keys (CMKs) which are critical for being able to decrypt data. AWS Security Hub provides
          this detection with the following check.

          Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for disabling or scheduled deletion of customer created CMKs

          This is scored as Minimal because CMKs only represent one type of data that could be
          destroyed by an adversary.

  Managed Insights: AWS Security Hub reports on collections of related findings which are known as
  managed insights. When possible, these managed insights are mapped to ATT&CK techniques (e.g., "S3
  buckets with public write or read permissions"). It should be noted that not all managed insights
  have the level of detail to be able to map them to ATT&CK techniques and are not included in the
  mapping (e.g., "EC2 instances involved in known Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)"). 

  AWS Config: AWS Security Hub supports reporting on findings from AWS Config (e.g., for CIS AWS
  Foundations Benchmark controls among others). Given that AWS Config is its own service, these
  findings will not be mapped to ATT&CK. The only controls that will be included in this mapping 
  are those for which Security Hub implements custom logic. It should also be noted that there will 
  be a future CTID project that maps specific CIS Benchmarks to ATT&CK techniques.
