        comments: >-
          This control may prevent harvesting of credentials from password stores by providing a
          secure, finely controlled location for secrets storage. This control is only relevant for
          credentials that would be used from application and configuration files and not those
          entered directly by an end user.

    technique-scores:
      - category: Protect
        value: Partial
        comments: >-
          This control may protect against exploitation for credential access by removing
          credentials and secrets from applications that can be exploited and requiring
          authenticated API calls to retrieve those credentials and secrets.

        comments: >-
          This control may prevent theft of application access tokens by replacing those tokens with
          authenticated and encrypted API calls to AWS Secrets Manager. This control is relevant for
          credentials stored in applications or configuration files but not credentials entered
          directly by a user.

              This control may prevent harvesting of unsecured credentials by removing credentials
              and secrets from applications and configuration files and requiring authenticated API
              calls to retrieve those credentials and secrets. This control is relevant for
              credentials stored in applications or configuration files but not credentials entered
              directly by a user.
