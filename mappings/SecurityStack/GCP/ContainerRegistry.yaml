  Container Registry is Google Cloud's service that provides a single location for storing and
  managing container images that support Docker Image Manifest V2 and OCI image formats. Container
  Analysis is the vulnerability scanning feature in Container Registry that detects software
  weaknesses from the following sources: Debian, Ubuntu, Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, National
  Vulnerability Database.

          Using Container Analysis, Container Registry scans the repository for vulnerabilities that
          could potentially be used to escalate privileges, such as default accounts with root
          permissions in Docker containers. Due to the medium threat protection coverage and scan
          results being available 48 hours after completion, this control was scored as partial.

          Container Registry scans the repository for known software vulnerabilities and various
          system artifacts that could potentially be used to execute adversary-controlled code. Due
          to the medium threat protection coverage and temporal factor, this control was scored as
          partial.

          Using Container Analysis and Vulnerability scanning, this security solution can detect
          known vulnerabilities in Docker containers. This information can be used to detect images
          that deviate from the baseline norm, and could indicate a malicious implanted images in
          the environment. Due to the medium threat detection coverage and temporal factor, the
          control was scored as partial.

          Once this control is deployed, it can scan for known vulnerabilities in containers. This
          information can be used to detect malicious deployed containers used to evade defenses and
          execute processes in a target environment. Due to the medium threat detection coverage and
          temporal factor, the control was scored as partial.

          Once this control is deployed, it can detect known vulnerabilities in various OS packages
          that could be used to escalate privileges and execute adversary-controlled code (e.g.,
          Debian, Ubuntu, Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, National Vulnerability Database). Due to the medium
          threat detection coverage and temporal factor, the control was scored as partial.

  Google Cloud's Artifact Registry is the recommended service for managing containers. Container
  Registry provides a subset of the features found in Artifact Registry and will only receive
  critical security fixes.
