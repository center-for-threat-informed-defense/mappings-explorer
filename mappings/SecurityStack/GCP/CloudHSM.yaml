  Google Cloud's Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a security feature available under Google Cloud
  Key Management Service that allows customers to host encryption keys and perform cryptographic
  operations in a FIPS 140-2 level 3 certified environment.

          Google Cloud's HSM may protect against adversary's attempts to leverage unsecured
          credentials found on compromised systems. Variations of this technique are difficult to
          mitigate, so a partial score was granted for this control's medium to high coverage
          factor.

          Google Cloud's HSM may protect against adversary's attempts to undermine trusted controls
          and conduct nefarious activity or execute malicious programs. Variations of this technique
          are difficult to mitigate, so a partial score was granted for this control's medium to
          high coverage factor.

        value: Partial
        comments: >-
          Google Cloud's HSM may protect against adversary's attempts to compromise code signing
          certificates that can used during targeting to run compromised code and other tampered
          executables. Variations of this technique are difficult to mitigate, so a partial score
          was granted for this control's medium to high coverage factor.

          Google Cloud's HSM may protect against adversary's attempts to compromise digital
          certificates that can used to encrypt data-in-transit or tamper with the certificate
          owner's communications.  Variations of this technique are difficult to mitigate, so a
          partial score was granted for this control's medium to high coverage factor.

          Google Cloud's HSM may protect against adversary's attempts to compromise private key
          certificate files (e.g., .key, .pgp, .ppk, .p12). Variations of this technique are
          difficult to mitigate, so a partial score was granted for this control's medium to high
          coverage factor.

          Google Cloud's HSM may protect against adversary's attempts to leverage passwords and
          unsecure credentials found in files on compromised systems.Variations of this technique
          are difficult to mitigate, so a partial score was granted for this control's medium to
          high coverage factor.

        comments: >-
          Google Cloud's HSM may protect against adversary's attempts to obtain capabilities by
          compromising code signing certificates that will be used to run compromised code and other
          tampered executables. Variations of this technique are difficult to mitigate, so a partial
          score was granted for this control's medium to high coverage factor.
comments: This control provides a secure alternative to storing encryption keys in the file system.
