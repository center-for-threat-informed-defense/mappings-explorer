  Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) includes a number of features that can be used to protect access to
  Google Cloud hosted resources and applications hosted on Google. IAP lets you establish a central
  authorization layer for applications accessed by HTTPS, so you can use an application-level access
  control model instead of relying on network-level firewalls.

          This control may mitigate application access token theft if the application is configured
          to retrieve temporary security credentials using an IAM role.

          Adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud account to maintain
          persistent access to victim accounts and instances within the environment. IAP lets you
          enforce access control policies for applications and resources. This control may help
          mitigate against adversaries gaining access through cloud account by the configuration of
          access controls and firewalls, allowing limited access to systems.

          IAP applies the relevant IAM policy to check if the user is authorized to access the
          requested resource. If the user has the IAP-secured Web App User role on the Cloud console
          project where the resource exists, they're authorized to access the application. This
          control can mitigate against adversaries that try to obtain credentials of accounts,
          including cloud accounts.

          When an application or resource is protected by IAP, it can only be accessed through the
          proxy by principals, also known as users, who have the correct Identity and Access
          Management (IAM) role. IAP secures authentication and authorization of all requests to App
          Engine, Cloud Load Balancing (HTTPS), or internal HTTP load balancing.


          With adversaries that may try to attempt malicious activity via applications, the
          application Firewalls may be used to limit exposure of applications to prevent exploit
          traffic from reaching the application.
comments: >-
  This mapping was scored as Partial due the control's low to medium threat protection fidelity from
  specific (sub-)techniques found in MITREâ€™s ATT&CK framework.
