          VirusTotal, now part of Google Cloud, provides threat context and reputation data to help
          analyze suspicious files, URLs, domains, and IP addresses to detect cybersecurity
          threats.  This control can help mitigate adversaries that try to send malware via
          emails using malicious links or attachments. The malware-scanner service scans the
          uploaded document for malware.

          If the document is infected, the service moves it to a quarantined bucket; otherwise the
          document is moved into another bucket that holds uninfected scanned documents.

          Adversaries may send spearphishing messages with a malicious link to elicit sensitive
          information that can be used during targeting. VirusTotal Graph is a visualization tool
          built on top of the VirusTotal data set. It analyzes the relationship between files, URLs,
          domains, IP addresses, and other items encountered.

  This mapping was scored as significant due to the controlâ€™s high threat protection coverage to
  specific ATT&CK (sub-)techniques and temporal factors (e.g., real-time).
