  Google Cloud VPC Firewalls can allow or deny traffic based on the traffic's protocol, destination
  ports, sources, and destinations and. VPC firewalls are stateful and exist not only between your
  instances and other networks, but also between individual instances within the same network.
  Connections are allowed or denied on a per-instance basis.  Firewall activity can be captured via
  Firewall rules logging and analyzed with Firewall Insights.

    technique-scores:
      - category: Protect
        value: Partial
        comments: "Google Cloud Firewalls can allow or deny traffic based on the traffic's protocol, destination ports, sources, and destinations. This functionality can be used to only allow remote services from trusted hosts (i.e., only allow remote access traffic from certain hosts). This mapping is given a score of Partial because even though it can restrict remote services traffic from untrusted hosts for most of the sub-techniques (5 of 6), it cannot protect against an adversary using a trusted host that is permitted to use remote services as part of an attack."

    name: External Remote Services
    technique-scores:
      - category: Protect
        value: Partial
        comments: "Google Cloud Firewalls can allow or deny traffic based on the traffic's protocol, destination ports, sources, and destinations. This functionality can be used to only allow certain remote services to be available. Furthermore, it can enforce restrictions such that remote services are only from trusted hosts (i.e., only allow remote access traffic from certain hosts). This mapping is given a score of Partial because while it can limit which external remote services and hosts can be used to access the network, it cannot protect against the misuse of legitimate external remote services (e.g., it cannot protect against an adversary using a trusted host that is permitted to use remote services as part of an attack)."

      - category: Protect
        value: Significant
        comments: "Google Cloud Firewalls can allow or deny traffic based on the traffic's protocol, destination ports, sources, and destinations. This functionality can be used to block SMB and WebDAV traffic from exiting the network which can protect against adversaries from forcing authentication over SMB and WebDAV. This mapping is given a score of Significant because Google Cloud Firewalls can block this traffic or restrict where it can go to."

    name: Traffic Signaling
    technique-scores:
      - category: Protect
        value: Partial
        comments: "Google Cloud Firewalls can allow or deny traffic based on the traffic's protocol, destination ports, sources, and destinations. This functionality can be used to block traffic to unused ports from reaching hosts on the network which may help protect against traffic signaling from external systems. This mapping is given a score of partial because the Google Cloud Firewalls does not do anything to protect against traffic signaling among hosts within the network and behind the firewall."

    name: Network Denial of Service
    technique-scores:
      - category: Protect
        value: Minimal
        comments: "Google Cloud Firewalls can allow or deny traffic based on the traffic's protocol, destination ports, sources, and destinations. This functionality can be used to block the sources of smaller-scale network denial of service attacks. While Google Cloud Firewalls support both sub-techniques (2 of 2), this mapping is given a score of Minimal because often times it is necessary to block the traffic at an Internet Service Provider or Content Provider Network level."

    name: Endpoint Denial of Service
    technique-scores:
      - category: Protect
        value: Partial
        comments: "Google Cloud Firewalls can allow or deny traffic based on the traffic's protocol, destination ports, sources, and destinations. This functionality can be used to block adversaries from carrying out denial of service attacks by implementing restrictions on which IP addresses and domains can access the resources (e.g., allow lists) as well as which protocol traffic is permitted. That is, Google Cloud Firewalls could block the source of the denial-of-service attack. This mapping is given a score of Partial because it only supports a subset of the sub-techniques (3 of 4) and because the source of the attack would have to be known before rules could be put in place to protect against it."

    technique-scores:
      - category: Protect
        value: Partial
        comments: "Google Cloud Firewalls can allow or deny traffic based on the traffic's protocol, destination ports, sources, and destinations. This functionality can be used to block adversaries from accessing resources such as cloud storage objects by implementing restrictions on which IP addresses and domains can access the resources (e.g., allow lists). However, since cloud storage objects are located outside the virtual private cloud where Google Cloud Firewalls protect, the mapping is only given a score of Partial."

  Documentation is segmented into 4 sections: VPC Firewall rules, Hierarchical firewall policies,
  Firewall insights, Firewall rules logging. These sections are listed under Firewall Insights and
  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) rather than a generic Firewall documentation page. Its unclear if the
  data in these sections should correspond to the "Firewalls" control, or the parent control under
  which its documented.
