  Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides the ability to secure containers across many layers of the
  stack, to include container images, container runtime, cluster network, and access to cluster
  API.

          By default, GKE nodes use Google's Container-Optimized OS to enhance the security of GKE
          clusters, including: Locked down firewall, read-only filesystem, limited user accounts,
          and disabled root login.

          GKE provides the ability to audit against a Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmark
          which is a set of recommendations for configuring Kubernetes to support a strong security
          posture. The Benchmark is tied to a specific Kubernetes release.

          Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC), uses granular permissions to control access to
          resources within projects and objects within Kubernetes clusters.

          GKE provides the ability to audit against a set of recommended benchmark [Center for
          Internet Security (CIS)]. This control may avoid privileged containers and running
          containers as root.

          This control may provide provide information about vulnerabilities within container
          images, such as the risk from remote management of a deployed container. With the right
          permissions, an adversary could escalate to remote code execution in the Kubernetes
          cluster.

          After scanning for vulnerabilities, this control may alert personnel of tampered container
          images that could be running in a Kubernetes cluster.

  This control provides information about security best practices and policies to apply when
  deploying Google Kubernetes Engine.
