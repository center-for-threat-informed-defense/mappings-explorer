For example, it can enforce that users on unmanaged devices will have browser-only access to SharePoint with no ability to download, print, or sync files.  Furthermore, with its integration with Microsoft Cloud App Security, it can even restrict  cut, copy and paste operations.  This can impede an adversary's ability to collect valuable information and/or files from the application.   This protection is partial as it doesn't prohibit an adversary from potentially viewing sensitive information and manually collecting it, for example simply writing down information by hand.",
