Some of the major categories of malware are:\n\nViruses that infect other programs and data, and spread through your computer or network looking for programs to infect.\nSpyware that gathers your personal information, such as sign-in information and personal data, and sends it back to its author.\nRansomware that encrypts your data and demands payment to decrypt it. Anti-malware software doesn't help you decrypt encrypted files, but it can detect the malware payload that's associated with the ransomware.\nEOP offers multi-layered malware protection that's designed to catch all known malware in Windows, Linux, and Mac that travels into or out of your organization. The following options help provide anti-malware protection:\n\nLayered defenses against malware: Multiple anti-malware scan engines help protect against both known and unknown threats. These engines include powerful heuristic detection to provide protection even during the early stages of a malware outbreak. This multi-engine approach has been shown to provide significantly more protection than using just one anti-malware engine.\nReal-time threat response: During some outbreaks, the anti-malware team might have enough information about a virus or other form of malware to write sophisticated policy rules that detect the threat, even before a definition is available from any of the scan engines used by the service. These rules are published to the global network every 2 hours to provide your organization with an extra layer of protection against attacks.\nFast anti-malware definition deployment: The anti-malware team maintains close relationships with partners who develop anti-malware engines. As a result, the service can receive and integrate malware definitions and patches before they're publicly released. Our connection with these partners often allows us to develop our own remedies as well.

Some of the major categories of malware are:\n\nViruses that infect other programs and data, and spread through your computer or network looking for programs to infect.\nSpyware that gathers your personal information, such as sign-in information and personal data, and sends it back to its author.\nRansomware that encrypts your data and demands payment to decrypt it. Anti-malware software doesn't help you decrypt encrypted files, but it can detect the malware payload that's associated with the ransomware.\nEOP offers multi-layered malware protection that's designed to catch all known malware in Windows, Linux, and Mac that travels into or out of your organization. The following options help provide anti-malware protection:\n\nLayered defenses against malware: Multiple anti-malware scan engines help protect against both known and unknown threats. These engines include powerful heuristic detection to provide protection even during the early stages of a malware outbreak. This multi-engine approach has been shown to provide significantly more protection than using just one anti-malware engine.\nReal-time threat response: During some outbreaks, the anti-malware team might have enough information about a virus or other form of malware to write sophisticated policy rules that detect the threat, even before a definition is available from any of the scan engines used by the service. These rules are published to the global network every 2 hours to provide your organization with an extra layer of protection against attacks.\nFast anti-malware definition deployment: The anti-malware team maintains close relationships with partners who develop anti-malware engines. As a result, the service can receive and integrate malware definitions and patches before they're publicly released.

AIR capabilities include automated investigation processes in response to well-known threats that exist today. Appropriate remediation actions await approval, enabling your security operations team to respond effectively to detected threats.

Attacks typically employ various techniques against different types of entities, such as devices, users, and mailboxes. The result of this is multiple alerts for multiple entities in your tenant. Piecing the individual alerts together to gain insight into an attack can be challenging and time-consuming, Microsoft Defender XDR automatically aggregates the alerts and their associated information into an incident. A typical Incident Response workflow in Microsoft Defender XDR begins with a triage action, next is the investigate action, and finally is the response action.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Defender Incident Response responds to Command and Scripting Interpreter attacks due to Incident Response monitoring for reconnaissance and discovery alerts which monitors for subsequent behavior related to discovery.\n\nLicense Requirements:\nMicrosoft Defender XDR",

Attacks typically employ various techniques against different types of entities, such as devices, users, and mailboxes. The result of this is multiple alerts for multiple entities in your tenant. Piecing the individual alerts together to gain insight into an attack can be challenging and time-consuming, Microsoft Defender XDR automatically aggregates the alerts and their associated information into an incident. A typical Incident Response workflow in Microsoft Defender XDR begins with a triage action, next is the investigate action, and finally is the response action.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Defender Incident Response responds to Cloud Service Dashboard attacks due to Incident Response monitoring for newly constructed logon behavior across cloud service management consoles and the aggregated alerts allowing admins to correlate security systems with login information, such as user accounts, IP addresses, and login names.\n\nLicense Requirements:\nMicrosoft Defender XDR",

With this level of visibility, you can quickly hunt for threats that traverse sections of your network, including sophisticated intrusions that arrive on email or the web, elevate local privileges, acquire privileged domain credentials, and move laterally to across your devices. Advanced hunting supports two modes, guided and advanced. Users use advanced mode if they are comfortable using Kusto Query Language (KQL) to create queries from scratch.\n\nAdvanced Threat Hunting Detects Multi-Factor Authentication attacks due to the IdentityLogonEvents table in the advanced hunting schema which contains information about all authentication activities related to Microsoft online services captured by Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.\n\nLicense Requirements:\nMicrosoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps,  Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2",

With this level of visibility, you can quickly hunt for threats that traverse sections of your network, including sophisticated intrusions that arrive on email or the web, elevate local privileges, acquire privileged domain credentials, and move laterally to across your devices. Advanced hunting supports two modes, guided and advanced. Users use advanced mode if they are comfortable using Kusto Query Language (KQL) to create queries from scratch.\n\nAdvanced Threat Hunting Detects Exfiltration Over Webhook attacks due to the DeviceNetworkEvents table in the advanced hunting schema which contains information about network connections and related events which monitor network data for uncommon data flows.\n\nLicense Requirements:\nMicrosoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps,  Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2",
