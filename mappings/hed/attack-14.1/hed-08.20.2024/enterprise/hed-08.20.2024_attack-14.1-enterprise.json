BitLocker also adds pre-boot authentication to access the encryption keys used for FDE.\n\nBitLocker is a Windows security feature that provides encryption for entire volumes, addressing the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned devices. BitLocker also uses Intel PTT to check integrity of early boot components, configuration data as well as OS components preventing attacks that perform modifications of those components.\n\nData on the encrypted volume can't be accessed without entering the PIN. TPMs (Intel PTT) also have anti-hammering protection that is designed to prevent brute force attacks that attempt to determine the PIN. BitLocker can protect from sensitive information theft while the drive is locked.",

            "comments": "Intel® Threat Detection Technology (TDT) with CrowdStrike's Accelerated Memory Scanning (AMS) provides security capabilities to enhance cybersecurity defenses. This dynamic solution improves CrowdStrike's Next-Generation Antivirus (NGAV) by enabling the detection of cyber threats earlier in the kill chain and in real time, with minimal impact on system performance.\n\nExploits targeting authentication mechanisms, such as those using stolen credentials or bypassing traditional authentication processes, are common tactics for gaining unauthorized access to systems. Intel® TDT plays a crucial role by providing deep, real-time detection on program execution, memory access, and control flow at the hardware level. This data helps security teams detect abnormal behaviors, such as suspicious authentication attempts or unauthorized interactions that could indicate misuse of alternate authentication material.\n\nIn addition, AMS offloads the performance-intensive task of memory scanning from the CPU to the Intel® Integrated GPU, ensuring faster and more efficient detection of malicious activity.
