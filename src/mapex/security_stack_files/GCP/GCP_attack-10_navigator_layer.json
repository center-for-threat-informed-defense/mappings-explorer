Cloud Audit Admin Activity logs are always enabled by default and cannot be disabled. SCC Premium consumes logs automatically when activated. SSH Logs and syslog inform the brute force detector, and the set of network logs (VPC Flow/Cloud Firewall/Cloud NAT/Cloud DNS).\n\nFurther automated response functionality can be extended in SCC to take actions against threats.
