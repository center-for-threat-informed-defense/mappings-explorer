  comments: "This mapping was rated as significant due to the control\u2019s notable\
    \ detection accuracy, mappable threat coverage, and time-related factors (e.g.,\
    \ real-time).\n\nSCC also provides users with compliance mappings that scan environments\
    \ against violations according to PCI-DSS v3.2.1, OWASP Top Ten, NIST 800-53,\
    \ and ISO 27001. \n\nTo improve cyber-situational awareness and detection against\
    \ various threats, SCC ingests logging data from multiple sources. Cloud Audit\
    \ Admin Activity logs are always enabled by default and cannot be disabled. SCC\
    \ Premium consumes logs automatically when activated. SSH Logs and syslog inform\
    \ the brute force detector, and the set of network logs (VPC Flow/Cloud Firewall/Cloud\
    \ NAT/Cloud DNS).\n\nFurther automated response functionality can be extended\
    \ in SCC to take actions against threats. A full list of automated actions can\
    \ be found on GCP's GitHub.\n\nReference: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/security-response-automation "
