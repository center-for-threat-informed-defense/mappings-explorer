  comments: 'This control provides risk detections that can be used to detect suspicious
    uses of valid accounts, e.g.:  Anonymous IP address, Atypical travel, Malware
    linked IP address, Unfamiliar sign-in properties, etc.  Microsoft utilizes machine
    learning and heuristic systems to reduce the false positive rate but there will
    be false positives.

    The temporal factor of this control''s detection is low because although there
    are some real-time detections most are offline detections (multi-day).'

  comments: 'When Azure Active Directory (AAD) Federation is configured for a tenant,
    an adversary that compromises a domain credential can use it to access (Azure)
    cloud resources. Identity Protection supports applying its risk detections (e.g.:  Anonymous
    IP address, Atypical travel, Malware linked IP address, Unfamiliar sign-in properties,
    etc.) to federated identities thereby providing detection mitigation for this
    risk. Because this detection is specific to an adversary utilizing valid domain
    credentials to access cloud resources and does not mitigate the usage of valid
    domain credentials to access on-premise resources, this detection has been scored
    as Partial.


    The temporal factor of this control''s detection is low because although there
    are some real-time detections most are offline detections (multi-day).'

    commandline switches" which can identify use of the net command to create user
    accounts, "User created by unauthorized user", "User Granted Access and associated

  comments: 'The following alert of this control is able to detect domain account
    discovery:  "Account enumeration reconnaissance (external ID 2003)".  This shouldn''t
    occur frequently and therefore the false positive rate should be minimal.

    The "Security principal reconnaissance (LDAP) (external ID 2038)" alert is also
    relevant and its machine learning capabilities should reduce the false positive
    rate.

    The "User and IP address reconnaissance (SMB) (external ID 2012)" alert can also

  capability_id: Azure DNS Alias Records
  comments: Alias records prevent dangling references by tightly coupling the life
    cycle of a DNS record with an Azure resource. For example, consider a DNS record
    that's qualified as an alias record to point to a public IP address or a Traffic
    Manager profile. If you delete those underlying resources, the DNS alias record
    becomes an empty record set. It no longer references the deleted resource.  This
    control is effective for protecting DNS records that resolve to Azure resources
    but does not offer protection for records pointing to non-Azure resources, resulting
    in a Partial score.

  comments: This control's Access Review feature supports scheduling a routine review

    to gain wide access.  This information can then be used to validate if such access
    is required and identify which (privileged) accounts should be monitored closely.  This
    reduces the availability of valid accounts to adversaries.  This review would
    normally be scheduled periodically, at most weekly, and therefore its temporal
    score is Partial.

    that users on unmanaged devices will have browser-only access to SharePoint/OneDrive
    with no ability to download, print, or sync files.  This can impede an adversary's
    ability to collect and stage files.  This offers minimal coverage as it requires
    the target application to support such a feature that can be triggered by this
    control and to date only a few (Office) applications support this.

  comments: This control's "Reduce lateral movement path risk to sensitive entities"
    recommendation can lead to protecting sensitive accounts against Pass-the-Hash
    and Pass-the-Ticket attacks that may result in an adversary acquiring a golden
    ticket.  It recommends running the Lateral-Movement-Paths report to understand
    and identify exactly how attackers can move laterally through the monitored network
    to gain access to privileged identities such as the KRBTGT on the domain controller.  Because
    this is a recommendation, its score has been capped as Partial.

    recommendation promotes running the "Unsecure Kerberos delegation" report that
    can identify accounts that have unsecure Kerberos delegation configured.  Unsecured
    Kerberos delegation can lead to exposing account TGTs to more hosts resulting
    in an increased attack surface for Kerberoasting.  Due to this control providing

  comments: 'All scores have been assessed as Partial because this control increases
    the strength of user passwords thereby reducing the likelihood of a successful
    brute force attack.  Due to the fact that a user''s password is not checked  against
    the banned list of passwords unless the user changes or resets their  password
    (which is an infrequent event), there is still ample opportunity  for attackers
    to utilize this technique to gain access. This is what prevented the score from

  attack_object_name: Port Knocking
  capability_id: Azure Firewall
  comments: This control can protect against this sub-technique by enforcing limited
    access to only required ports.  Consequently, even if the adversary is able to
    utilize port knocking to open additional ports at the host level, it is still
    blocked at the firewall service level. This service typically applies to external
    traffic and not internal traffic and therefore lateral movement using this technique
    within a network is still possible.  Due to this partial coverage, it has been
    scored as Partial.

  comments: 'Security controls like Azure AD Identity Protection can raise a user''s
    risk level asynchronously after they have used a valid account to access organizational
    data.  This CAE control can respond to this change in the users risky state to
    terminate the user''s access within minutes or enforce an additional authentication
    method such as MFA.   This mitigates the impact of an adversary using a valid
    account.  This is control only forces the user to re-authenticate and doesn''t
    resolve the usage of a valid account (i.e. password change) and is therefore a
    containment type of response. '
