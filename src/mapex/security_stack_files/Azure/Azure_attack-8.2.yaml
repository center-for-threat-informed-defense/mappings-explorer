  comments: 'This control provides risk detections that can be used to detect suspicious
    uses of valid accounts, e.g.:  Anonymous IP address, Atypical travel, Malware
    linked IP address, Unfamiliar sign-in properties, etc.  Microsoft utilizes machine
    learning and heuristic systems to reduce the false positive rate but there will
    be false positives.

    The temporal factor of this control''s detection is low because although there

  comments: 'When Azure Active Directory (AAD) Federation is configured for a tenant,
    an adversary that compromises a domain credential can use it to access (Azure)
    cloud resources. Identity Protection supports applying its risk detections (e.g.:  Anonymous
    IP address, Atypical travel, Malware linked IP address, Unfamiliar sign-in properties,
    etc.) to federated identities thereby providing detection mitigation for this
    risk. Because this detection is specific to an adversary utilizing valid domain
    credentials to access cloud resources and does not mitigate the usage of valid
    domain credentials to access on-premise resources, this detection has been scored
    as Partial.

  capability_id: Azure DNS Alias Records
  comments: Alias records prevent dangling references by tightly coupling the life
    cycle of a DNS record with an Azure resource. For example, consider a DNS record
    that's qualified as an alias record to point to a public IP address or a Traffic
    Manager profile. If you delete those underlying resources, the DNS alias record
    becomes an empty record set. It no longer references the deleted resource.  This
    control is effective for protecting DNS records that resolve to Azure resources
    but does not offer protection for records pointing to non-Azure resources, resulting
    in a Partial score.

    is required and identify which (privileged) accounts should be monitored closely.  This

    recommendation can lead to protecting sensitive accounts against Pass-the-Hash
    and Pass-the-Ticket attacks that may result in an adversary acquiring a golden
    ticket.  It recommends running the Lateral-Movement-Paths report to understand
    and identify exactly how attackers can move laterally through the monitored network
    to gain access to privileged identities such as the KRBTGT on the domain controller.  Because
    this is a recommendation, its score has been capped as Partial.

    brute force attack.  Due to the fact that a user''s password is not checked  against
    the banned list of passwords unless the user changes or resets their  password
    (which is an infrequent event), there is still ample opportunity  for attackers

  comments: Signature based antimalware solutions are generally dependent on Indicators
    of Compromise(IOCs) such as file hashes and malware signatures. ATT&CK is primarily
    centered on behaviors and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures(TTPs), hence the
    minimal amount of techinques and scoring.

  comments: This control can protect against this sub-technique by enforcing limited
    access to only required ports.  Consequently, even if the adversary is able to
    utilize port knocking to open additional ports at the host level, it is still
    blocked at the firewall service level. This service typically applies to external
    traffic and not internal traffic and therefore lateral movement using this technique
    within a network is still possible.  Due to this partial coverage, it has been
    scored as Partial.

    data.  This CAE control can respond to this change in the users risky state to
    terminate the user''s access within minutes or enforce an additional authentication
    method such as MFA.   This mitigates the impact of an adversary using a valid
    account.  This is control only forces the user to re-authenticate and doesn''t
    resolve the usage of a valid account (i.e. password change) and is therefore a
    containment type of response. '
