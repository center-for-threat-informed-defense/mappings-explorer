150,"Mappings for AWS IoT Device Defender audit are based on the current set of AWS IoT Device Defender audit checks that can be enabled. AWS IoT Device Defender's predefined mitigation actions are also included for those audit checks that support them. Audit checks can be run as needed (on-demand audits) or scheduled to be run periodically (scheduled audits), so temporal scoring factors are uniformly high for this control, based on the assumption that checks are run (at minimum) on a frequent basis. Audit check and mitigation names are identified in quotes throughout this mapping.
Mappings for AWS IoT Device Defender detect are based on the current set of AWS IoT Device Defender device-side and cloud-side detection metrics. Cloud-side detection alarms are triggered when set thresholds are exceeded, and device-side detection metrics are published on a chosen interval with a minimum value of 5 minutes, so temporal scoring factors are uniformly high for this control, based on the assumption that thresholds are set to sensible values that detect suspicious values quickly and device-side metric publishing is not set to an unreasonably large interval.
