  comments: 'ReCAPTCHA Enterprise allows users to configure Multifactor Authentication
    (MFA) to verify user''s identity by sending a verification code by email or SMS
    (known as an MFA challenge). When ReCAPTCHA Enterprise assesses that user activity
    to exceeds a predetermined threshold (by the developer), it can trigger an MFA
    challenge to verify the user. This increases the likelihood that a compromised
    account will be prevented from impacting the system.


    Since ReCAPTCHA Enterprise does not require a MFA challenge for all user activity,
    it has been given a rating of Partial.
