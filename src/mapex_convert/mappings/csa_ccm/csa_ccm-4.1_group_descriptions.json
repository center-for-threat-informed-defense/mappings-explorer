  {
    "id": "IPY",
    "description": "The Interoperability and Portability (IPY) domain addresses interoperability and portability in the cloud environment. Implementing robust interoperability and portability controls facilitates the safe and secure exchange of data across multiple platforms and CSPs, enabling CSCs to avoid vendor lock-in and fostering an environment where interoperability and portability are not hindered by security concerns."
  },
  {
    "id": "IVS",
    "description": "The Infrastructure and Virtualization Security (IVS) domain guides CSPs and CSCs in implementing controls to secure infrastructure and virtualization technologies. Infrastructure encompasses all hardware, software, networks, facilities, etc., required to deliver IT services. Virtualization technologies use software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements (such as processors, memory, storage, etc.) to be divided into virtual computers."
  },
  {
    "id": "LOG",
    "description": "The Logging and Monitoring (LOG) domain aids CSPs and CSCs in collecting, storing, analyzing and reporting on the activities and events that occur in their cloud environment. This in turn helps to detect and respond to security incidents, operational issues and system anomalies, comply with regulatory requirements, audit and verify the effectiveness of their security controls, and improve their security posture and performance."
