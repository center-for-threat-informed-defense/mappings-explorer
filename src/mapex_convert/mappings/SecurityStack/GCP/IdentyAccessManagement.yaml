description: >-
  Identity and Access Management (IAM) gives administrators fine-grained access control and
  visibility for centrally managing enterprise cloud resources. It gives more granular access to
  specific Google Cloud resources and prevents unwanted access to other resources. IAM lets users
  adopt the security principle of least privilege, so you grant only the necessary access to your
  resources.

          Privileged roles and permissions can be granted to entire groups of users by default, and
          admins can control unwanted access by utilizing machine learning to recommend smart access
          control permissions within an organization. This control can  help mitigate adversaries
          from gaining access to unwanted account.

        comments: >-
          Group permissions and settings are inherited using the IAM roles that are specifically
          granted to that group by admins. This control provides protection of possible adversaries
          that may determine which user accounts and groups memberships are available in cloud
          accounts. Received a score of Minimal because it only covers one of the sub-techniques.

          This control may mitigate the impact of compromised valid accounts by enabling
          fine-grained access policies and implementing least-privilege policies. MFA can provide
          protection against an adversary that obtains valid credentials by requiring the adversary
          to complete an additional authentication process before access is permitted.

          This control can be used to implement the least-privilege principle for account management
          and thereby limit the accounts that can be used for account discovery. This control
          receives a minimal score since it only covers one of the few sub-techniques.

          This control protects against adversaries gaining access to accounts within a specific
          environment or determining which accounts exists to follow on with malicious behavior. The
          usage of GCP IAM enables admins to grant access to cloud resources at fine-grained levels,
          possibly preventing adversaries of malicious use of cloud accounts and gaining access to
          them.  This control receives a minimal score since it only covers one of the few
          sub-techniques.

          GCP Identity and Access Management allows admins to control access to Container Registry
          hosts with Cloud Storage permissions. Specific accounts can be assigned roles and
          Container Registry uses Cloud Storage buckets as the underlying storage for container
          images. This control can help mitigate  against adversaries that may attempt to discover
          resources including images and containers by controlling access to  images by granting
          permissions to the bucket for a registry.
