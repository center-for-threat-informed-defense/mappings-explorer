description: >-
  Shielded VMs are virtual machines (VMs) on Google Cloud hardened by a set of security controls
  that help defend against rootkits and bootkits. Shielded VMs leverage advanced platform security
  capabilities such as secure and measured boot, a virtual trusted platform module (vTPM), UEFI
  firmware, and integrity monitoring.

          This control is able to mitigate malicious modification of any portion of the
          pre-os boot process through a combination of Secure Boot to verify signatures of firmware,
          Measured Boot to establish a known good boot baseline, and Integrity Monitoring to measure
          subsequent boots to previously established baselines.

        comments: >-
          This control is able to mitigate the use of rootkits that target any portion of the boot
          process, such as malicious modification of the Master Boot Record or UEFI. This control
          does not mitigate rootkits that exist in the kernel or userland.
