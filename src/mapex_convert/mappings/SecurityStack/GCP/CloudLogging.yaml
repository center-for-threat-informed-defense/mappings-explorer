description: >-
  Cloud Logging is a fully managed service that allows user to store, search, analyze, monitor, and
  alert on logging data and events from Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services.  User can collect
  logging data from over 150 common application components, on-premises systems, and hybrid cloud
  systems.

comments: >-
  This control is not mappable because it does not provide significant detection of malicious
  techniques. Some of the other security controls that this control maps to are Azure DNS Analytics,
  AWS CloudTrail, AWS S3, and AWS Audit Manager. The S3 server access logging feature was not mapped
  because it was deemed to be a data source that can be used with other detective controls rather
  than a security control in of itself.
