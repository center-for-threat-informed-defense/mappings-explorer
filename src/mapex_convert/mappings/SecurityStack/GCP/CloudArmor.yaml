  Cloud Armor protects applications by providing Layer 7 filtering and by scrubbing incoming
  requests for common web attacks or other Layer 7 attributes to potentially block traffic before it
  reaches load balanced backend services or backend buckets.

          Traffic to known anonymity networks and C2 infrastructure can be blocked through the use
          of network allow and block lists. However this can be circumvented by other techniques.

          Google Cloud Armor security policies protect your application by providing Layer 7
          filtering and by scrubbing incoming requests for common web attacks or other Layer 7
          attributes. Google Cloud Armor detects malicious requests and drops them at the edge of
          Google's infrastructure.

          Google Cloud Armor provides always-on DDoS protection against network or protocol-based
          volumetric DDoS attacks. It allows users to allow/deny traffic at the Google Cloud edge,
          closest to the source of traffic. This prevents unwelcome traffic from consuming
          resources.

          This control typically filters external network traffic and therefore can be effective for
          preventing external remote system discovery. Activity originating from inside the
          trusted network is not mitigated.

          This control typically filters external network traffic and therefore can be effective for
          preventing external network service scanning. Network service scanning originating from
          inside the trusted network is not mitigated.
