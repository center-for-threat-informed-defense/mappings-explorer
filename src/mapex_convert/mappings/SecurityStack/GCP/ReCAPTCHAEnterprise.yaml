          ReCAPTCHA Enterprise allows users to configure Multifactor Authentication (MFA) to verify
          user's identity by sending a verification code by email or SMS (known as an MFA
          challenge). When ReCAPTCHA Enterprise assesses that user activity to exceeds a
          predetermined threshold (by the developer), it can trigger an MFA challenge to verify the
          user. This increases the likelihood that a compromised account will be prevented from
          impacting the system.


          Since ReCAPTCHA Enterprise does not require a MFA challenge for all user activity, it has
          been given a rating of Partial.

          Password Checkup extension for Chrome displays a warning whenever a user signs in to a
          site using one of over 4 billion usernames and passwords that Google knows to be unsafe
          due to a third-party data breach. With reCAPTCHA Enterprise, you can identify credential
          stuffing attacks by utilizing Password Checkup to detect password leaks and breached
          credentials. Developers can factor this information into their score calculation for
          score-based site keys to help identify suspicious activity and take appropriate action.

          ReCAPTCHA Enterprise can implement a number of mitigations to prevent the automated
          creation of multiple accounts such as adding checkbox challenges on pages where end users
          need to enter their credentials and assessing user activity for potential misuses on all
          pages where accounts are created.


          Since this control doesn't prevent the manual creation of accounts, it has been given a
          rating of Partial.
