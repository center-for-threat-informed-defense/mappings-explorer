description: >-
  Cloud VPN securely connects your peer network to your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network through
  an IPsec VPN connection. Traffic traveling between the two networks is encrypted by one VPN
  gateway and then decrypted by the other VPN gateway. This action protects your data as it travels
  over the internet. You can also connect two instances of Cloud VPN to each other.

          Cloud VPN enables traffic traveling between the two networks, and it is encrypted by one
          VPN gateway and then decrypted by the other VPN gateway. This action protects users' data
          as it travels over the internet. This control may prevent adversaries from
          sniffing network traffic.

          This control provides protection against data from being manipulated by adversaries
          through target applications by encrypting important information. Since this control only
          provides protection against data in transit, it received a partial score.

          This control provides protections against adversaries who try to access and/or persist
          within a network. Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow
          users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations.
