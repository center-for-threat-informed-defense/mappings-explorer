description: >-
  Google Cloud's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) allows users to logically isolate resources and define
  security perimeters that filters [ingress and egress] traffic in a virtual network based on user
  identity or policies for cloud assets (e.g., instance or subnet).

          VPC further segments the environment by providing configurable granular access controls
          which help limit user communications to critical systems.

          VPC security perimeter mitigates the impact from Adversary-in-the-Middle by creating
          virtual segmentation that limits the data and information broadcast on the network.

          VPC security perimeters can segment private resources to deny ingress and egress traffic
          based on organizational policies. Because this tool does not prevent attacks from valid accounts or compromised machines, it was scored as 
          minimal.
