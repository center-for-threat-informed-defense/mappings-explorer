        comments: >-
          This control is able to mitigate against a variety of phishing attacks by requiring an
          additional key for authentication outside of the user's password. Compared to other forms
          of 2-factor authentication, this control will not allow for authentication to an
          illegitimate service or website as the key can not be transmitted from the hardware device
          to any other device.
