description: >-
  Security Command Center (SCC) provides analysts with a centralized dashboard for cyber situational
  awareness by aggregating threat and vulnerability reports. SCC works by scanning for weaknesses or
  monitoring an organization's logging stream for anomalies (e.g., Google Workspace logs,
  containers, vulnerabilities in web applications, and hypervisor-level instrumentation). To
  further mitigate risks in the infrastructure, SCC easily integrates with other Google Cloud
  security solutions: Cloud DLP, Chronicle, Binary Authorization, Cloud Armor, and 3rd party
  solutions (e.g., SIEM, SOAR). The cyber-attacks in this solution are correlated to SCC's
  premium tier which included additional security features for: Event Threat Detection, Container
  Threat Detection, Virtual Machine Threat Detection, Web Security Scanner, and Security Health

          Using Web Security Scanner, SCC is able to detect repositories (e.g., Git or SVN) that are
          exposed to the public. Adversaries may use this lapse in security configuration to collect
          information about the target. Because of the near-real time temporal factor to detect
          against this cyber-attack this was graded as significant.

        value: Minimal
        comments: >-
          Using Web Security Scanner, SCC is able to detect when passwords are transmitted in
          cleartext. Adversaries may use this traffic mirroring services to sniff traffic and
          intercept unencrypted credentials. This technique was graded as partial due to the low
          protect coverage when transmitting passwords in clear-text and there is more information
          that could be gathered during a network sniffing attacks.

          Using Web Security Scanner, SCC is able to detect and provide guidance for web application
          security risks (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, SQL injection, Server Side Request Forgery,
          Insecure Deserialization). Adversaries may exploit these web app weaknesses in a
          cloud-based environment to compromise the underlying instance or container. This technique

        value: Significant
        comments: >-
          SCC is able to detect when audit logging has been disabled for a resource. Adversaries may
          use this weakness to hide their activity and remove evidence of their presence (e.g.,
          clear command history, clear logs, file deletion). This technique was graded as
          significant due to the high detect coverage and real-time temporal factor.

          SCC ingests admin activity from Cloud Audit logs to detect when an external member is
          added to a privileged group with sensitive permissions or roles. This security solution
          protects against adversary created accounts used to establish or maintain persistence.
          Because of the temporal factor to detect this attack, the control was graded as

          SCC ingests admin activity from Cloud Audit logs to detect when new service accounts are
          created. This security solution protects against potential adversary generated accounts
          used for initial access or to maintain persistence. Because of the temporal factor to
          detect this attack the control was graded as significant.

          SCC detect changes to the configuration which would lead to disable logging on an instance
          or container. This security solution protects against system modifications used to remove
          evidence and evade defenses. Because of the near-real time temporal factor this control
          was graded as significant.

        comments: >-
          SCC detect changes to the cloud infrastructure and resources which could indicate
          malicious behavior (e.g., delete instances, create snapshot, revert cloud instance).
          This security solution protects against modifications potentially used to remove evidence
          and evade defenses. Because of the near-real time temporal factor and high detection
          coverage this control was graded as significant.

      - category: Detect
        value: Partial
        comments: >-
          SCC detect suspicious activity when accessing cloud storage objects (e.g.,  new IPs
          accessing storage objects or enumeration from unfamiliar user identities). Because of the
          real time temporal factor when detecting access to secure storage objects this control
          was graded as partial.
comments: >-
  This mapping was rated as significant due to the control’s notable detection accuracy, mappable
  threat coverage, and time-related factors (e.g., real-time).


  SCC also provides users with compliance mappings that scan environments against violations
  according to PCI-DSS v3.2.1, OWASP Top Ten, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001. 


  To improve cyber-situational awareness and detection against various threats, SCC ingests logging
  data from multiple sources. Cloud Audit Admin Activity logs are always enabled by default and
  cannot be disabled. SCC Premium consumes logs automatically when activated. SSH Logs and syslog
  inform the brute force detector, and the set of network logs (VPC Flow/Cloud Firewall/Cloud
  NAT/Cloud DNS).


  Further automated response functionality can be extended in SCC to take actions against threats. A
  full list of automated actions can be found on GCP's GitHub.
