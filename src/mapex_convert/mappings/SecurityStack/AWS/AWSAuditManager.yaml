description: >-
  AWS Audit Manager automates evidence collection from other services (notably AWS Config, AWS
  Security Hub, AWS API calls, and AWS CloudTrail) for evaluation against compliance
  frameworks/regulations and transformation into audit-friendly reports.
techniques: []
comments: >-
  This control was not mapped because AWS Audit Manager is used to aggregate evidence from other
  services in order to produce audit-ready reports, not provide protection against any ATT&CK
  techniques or adversary behaviors. All protections against ATT&CK techniques are provided by the
  lower-level services used for the evidence collection, which are assessed in different mappings.
