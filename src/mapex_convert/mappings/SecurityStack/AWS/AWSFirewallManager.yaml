description: >-

  rules and security groups for AWS WAF, AWS Shield, AWS VPC, AWS Network Firewall, and Amazon Route
  53 Resolvers DNS Firewall across multiple AWS accounts and resources.

comments: >-
  This control was not mapped because AWS Firewall Manager is simply a management service for other
  AWS security services. It does not inherently protect against any ATT&CK (sub-)techniques. All
  protections against ATT&CK (sub-)techniques are provided by the lower-level services that it manages
  (e.g., AWS WAF, AWS Network Firewall, etc.).  This is evident by the fact that to use firewall
  rules or security groups, they must first be configured in the respective lower-level services.
