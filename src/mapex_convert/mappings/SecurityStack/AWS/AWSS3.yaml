  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading
  scalability, data availability, security, and performance.  Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can
  use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.

          AWS S3 may protect against data destruction through application of several best practices.
          Multi-factor authentication can be enabled for delete operations and for changing the
          versioning state of a bucket. Versioning can be enabled to revert objects to a previous
          state after malicious destruction or corruption. S3 Object Lock can help prevent objects
          from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.  In addition,
          S3 Cross Region Replication can be used to replicate S3 buckets to another AWS region for
          add protection.

          S3 provides full control of access via Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and with
          its access control lists (ACLs). The S3 Block Public Access feature allows for policies limiting public
          access to Amazon S3 resources that are enforced regardless of how the resources are
          created or associated IAM policies. Server-side encryption can be enabled for data at rest and allows
          for use of S3-managed keys, AWS Key Management Service managed keys, or customer-provided keys.
comments: >-
  The S3 server access logging feature was not mapped because it was deemed to be a data source that can be
  used with other detective controls rather than a security control in of itself.
