description: >-
  AWS CloudHSM provides hardware security modules (HSM) in the AWS Cloud.  Using this service allows
  generating, storing, importing, exporting, and managing cryptographic keys, including symmetric keys
  and asymmetric key pairs.

        comments: >-
          This control's protection is specific to a minority of this technique's sub-techniques and
          procedure examples resulting in a Minimal Coverage score and consequently an overall score
          of Minimal.

              This service provides a more secure alternative to storing encryption keys in the file system.
              As a result of this service only supporting cryptographic keys and not other types of credentials,
              the coverage score is assessed as Partial resulting in an overall Partial score.

            comments: >-
              This service allows for securely storing encryption keys and enforcing fine-grained access to the keys.
              The service does not allow anyone access to retrieve plaintext keys from the service.

              Certificate credentials can be stored in AWS CloudHSM which reduces the attack surface and
              threat from these sub-techniques.

          This service provides protection against sub-techniques involved with stealing credentials, certificates,
          and keys from the organization.

              Use cases in documentation show that certificate credentials can be stored in AWS CloudHSM which reduces
              the attack surface and threat from these sub-techniques.
