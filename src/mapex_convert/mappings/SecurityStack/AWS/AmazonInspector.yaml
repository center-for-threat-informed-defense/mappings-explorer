  Amazon Inspector is an automated assessment service that evaluates the security and compliance of
  applications in AWS. It supports assessment packages for CVEs, CIS Benchmarks (various Windows and
  Linux platforms), Best Practices (Linux only), and Network Reachability. The result of running an
  assessment is a list of findings that can be used to inform decision-making processes that improve
  the security of applications.

          Amazon Inspector can detect known vulnerabilities on various Windows and Linux endpoints.
          Furthermore, the Amazon Inspector Best Practices assessment package can assess security
          controls for "Enable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)" and "Enable Data Execution
          Prevention (DEP)" that makes it more difficult for an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities
          in software. This information can be used to patch, isolate, and remove vulnerable
          software and endpoints. Amazon Inspector does not directly protect against exploitation
          and it is not effective against zero-day attacks, vulnerabilities with no available patch,
          and software that may not be analyzed by the scanner. As a result, the score is capped at
          Partial.

          The Amazon Inspector Best Practices assessment package can detect security control
          settings related to authentication and password policies on Linux endpoints. Specific
          security controls it can assess include "Disable password authentication over SSH",
          "Configure password maximum age", "Configure password minimum length", and "Configure
          password complexity" all of which impact the ability to brute force a password. This
          information can be used identify insecure configurations and harden the endpoints. Amazon
          Inspector does not directly protect against brute force attacks. Given Amazon Inspector
          can only assess these security controls on Linux platforms (although it also supports
          Windows), the coverage score is Minimal leading to an overall Minimal score.

          The Amazon Inspector Best Practices assessment package can detect a security control

          The Amazon Inspector Best Practices assessment package can assess security control
          "Configure permissions for system directories" that prevents privilege escalation by local
          users and ensures only the root account can modify/execute system configuration
          information and binaries. Amazon Inspector does not directly protect against system
          modifications rather it just checks to see if security controls are in place which can
          inform decisions around hardening the system. Due to this and the fact the security
          control is only supported for Linux platforms, the score is Minimal.

          The Amazon Inspector Network Reachability assessment package can assess whether or not
          cloud/network components are vulnerable (e.g., publicly accessible from the Internet).
          Amazon Inspector does not directly protect cloud/network components rather reports on
          vulnerabilities that it identifies which can then be used to securely configure the
          cloud/network components. Due to this, the score is capped at Partial.

  The CIS Benchmarks assessment package is considered out of scope because a separate project will
  be responsible for mapping CIS Benchmarks and ATT&CK.
