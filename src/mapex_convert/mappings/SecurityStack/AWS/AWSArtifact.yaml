description: >-
  AWS Artifact is a central resource that provides on-demand access to AWS's security and compliance
  reports and online agreements. Available reports include Service Organization Control (SOC)
  reports, Payment Card Industry (PCI) reports, and certifications from accreditation bodies across
  geographies and compliance verticals that validate the implementation and operating effectiveness
  of AWS security controls. Agreements available include the Business Associate Addendum (BAA) and
  the Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA).
techniques: []
comments: >-
  This control was not mapped because AWS Artifact provides access to reports and information but
  does not protect against any ATT&CK techniques. All protections against ATT&CK techniques are
  provided by the lower-level services evaluated by and referenced in those reports.
