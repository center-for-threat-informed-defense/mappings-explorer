  Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity
  and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3.
  The service uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to
  identify and prioritize potential threats. GuardDuty analyzes tens of billions of events across
  multiple AWS data sources, such as AWS CloudTrail event logs, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.

          Documentation states that the Service can flag such attempts: Reconnaissance -- Activity
          suggesting reconnaissance by an attacker, such as unusual API activity, intra-VPC port
          scanning, unusual patterns of failed login requests, or unblocked port probing from a
          known bad IP. Note: This is from the perspective of the resource running in the AWS
          account. Meaning GuardDuty has several finding types that flag events that take place via
          a resource (e.g., EC2, IAM, S3).

          are leveraged to capture data not intended to be viewable (e.g., IAM credentials

          MetadataDNSRebind and is more focused on the EC2 instance and not the application running

          GuardDuty provides multiple finding types that flag malicious activity against resources.
          These findings focus on API calls that look suspicious and although they do not flag events
          such as Defacement specifically, it can be inferred that these findings can result in mitigating
          this technique's negative impact. With this assumption the score is capped at Partial.

  Scores for this service are capped at Partial due to limited coverage and accuracy information.

  The temporal factor for this control is consistent: the first instance of a finding taking place
  is alerted within 5 minutes of the event occurring. After that any subsequent events can be
  customized to be reported at 15 minutes, 1 hour, or the default of 6 hours.

  The following findings were not mappable:
    Backdoor:EC2/Spambot
    Impact:EC2/AbusedDomainRequest.Reputation
    InitialAccess:IAMUser/AnomalousBehavior
