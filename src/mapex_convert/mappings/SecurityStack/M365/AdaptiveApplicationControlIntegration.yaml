description: Adaptive Application Control Integration, formerly Azure Security Center's Adaptive Application Controls, uses machine learning to analyze the applications running on machines and create a list of known-safe software. Allow lists are based on specific  workloads, trusted paths, publishers, and hashes and can be further customized. Security alerts are generated when applications are run that have not been defined as safe.
