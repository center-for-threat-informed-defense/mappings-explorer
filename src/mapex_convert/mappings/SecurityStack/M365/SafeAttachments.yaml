description: Safe Attachments provides an additional layer of protection against
  malware and protects your organization from inadvertently sharing malicious
  files. After files are asynchronously scanned by the common virus detection
  engine in Microsoft 365, Safe Attachments opens files in a virtual environment
  to see what happens (a process known as detonation).
