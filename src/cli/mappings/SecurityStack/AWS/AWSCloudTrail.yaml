description: >-
  AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable governance, compliance, and operational and
  risk auditing of your AWS account. Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded
  as events in CloudTrail.
techniques: []
comments: >-
  This control is not mappable because it does not provide any detection of malicious techniques. It
  primarily provides a way to log and record events within AWS which then can be piped to other
  security controls to determine if malicious activity has occurred.
