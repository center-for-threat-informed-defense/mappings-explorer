  AWS Single Sign-On is a cloud-based single sign-on (SSO) service that makes it easy to centrally
  manage SSO access to all your AWS accounts and cloud applications. Specifically, it helps you
  manage SSO access and user permissions across all your AWS accounts in AWS Organizations. AWS SSO
  also helps you manage access and permissions to commonly used third-party software as a service
  (SaaS) applications, AWS SSO-integrated applications as well as custom applications that support
  Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0.

              This control may protect against malicious use of valid accounts by implementing fine
              grained and least privilege access through use of permission sets (a collection of
              administrator-defined policies that AWS SSO uses to determine a user's effective permissions
              to access a given AWS account). The ability to reduce the set of credentials and accounts
              needed for a user allows for simpler and safer access and privilege management.

          This control may protect against abuse of external remote services by requiring
          multi-factor authentication for single sign-on accounts.

              This control may protect against brute force techniques by enabling multi-factor
              authentication. All accounts that can be replace with single sign-on can benefit from
              a unified multi-factor authentication requirement.
