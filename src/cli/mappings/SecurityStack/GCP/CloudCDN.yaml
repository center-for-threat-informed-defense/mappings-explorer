  Cloud CDN (Content Delivery Network) uses Google's global edge network to serve content closer to
  users, which accelerates access to websites and applications.

  Cloud CDN works with external HTTP(S) Load Balancing to deliver content to users. The
  external HTTP(S) load balancer provides the frontend IP addresses and ports that receive requests
  and the backends that respond to the requests.

          Cloud CDN acts as a proxy between clients and origin servers. Cloud CDN can distribute
          requests for cacheable content across multiple points-of-presence (POPs), thereby
          providing a larger set of locations to absorb a DOS attack.


          However, Cloud CDN doesn't provide protection against DOS attacks for uncached content.
