          This control can be used to limit permissions to discover cloud accounts in accordance
          with least privilege principles and thereby limits the accounts that can be used for
          account discovery.

          IAM Recommender helps admins remove unwanted access to GCP resources by using machine
          learning to make smart access control recommendations. With Recommender, security teams
          can automatically detect overly permissive access and rightsize them based on similar
          users in the organization and their access patterns. This control may mitigate adversaries
          that try to enumerate users access keys through VM or snapshots.

          Recommender generates policy insights by comparing the permissions that each principal
          used during the past 90 days with the total permissions the principal has. This can be
          used to limit the permissions associated with creating and modifying platform images or
          containers that adversaries may try to access.

          Adversaries may attempt to implant cloud or container images with malicious code to gain
          access to an environment. The IAM audit logs can be used to receive data access and
          activity logs who has accessed to certain resources.

          This control may limit the number of users that have privileges to discover cloud
          infrastructure and may limit the discovery value of the dashboard in the event of a
          compromised account.

          Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges. This control can be
          used to help enforce least privilege principals to ensure that permission levels are
          properly managed. Along with this, Policy Analyzer lets users know what principals have
          access to resources based on its corresponding IAM allow policies.

          Adversaries that try to disable cloud logging capabilities have the advantage to limit the
          amount of the data that can be collected and can possibly control not being detected. This
          control may be used to ensure that permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from
          disabling or interfering with security/logging services.

          Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a cloud account by gaining access through

          Utilization and enforcement of MFA for user accounts to ensure that IAM policies are
          implemented properly shall mitigate adversaries so that they may not gain access to user
          accounts. Enforce the principle of least privilege by ensuring that principals have only
          the permissions that they actually need.

          Adversaries may modify file or directory permissions/attributes to evade access control
          lists (ACLs) and access protected files. Enforcing the principle of least privilege
          through IAM Recommender role recommendations help admins identify and remove excess
          permissions from users' principals, improving their resources' security configurations.
