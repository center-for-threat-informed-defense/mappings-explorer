        <p>The <a href="https://ctid.mitre.org/"
            target="_blank">Center for Threat-Informed Defense</a> creates solutions that expand upon the
          <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/" target="_blank">MITRE ATT&CK速</a>
          knowledge base to better understand cyber adversaries and their tradecraft in order to advance
          threat-informed defense. The following Center projects are most closely
          related to the security capability mappings projects presented in Mappings Explorer.

          <blockquote>
            <p>The Center for Threat-Informed Defense creates the data you see on this site using
              a specialized tool developed called
              Mappings Editor. This tool is optimized for mapping security
              capabilities to MITRE ATT&CK. It includes powerful features for
              efficiency and accuracy. We released it as a public beta
              for anybody who wants to create their own mappings, whether to share
              mappings of publicly known security capabilities, or to privately document your
              organization's internal security controls.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The ATT&CK Sync project streamlines upgrades to new versions of MITRE ATT&CK速 by providing tools
              and resources to migrate existing projects to current ATT&CK versions in a timely and efficient
              manner. The ATT&CK knowledge base is updated twice per year and with each new ATT&CK release,
              projects fall behind and become outdated. ATT&CK Sync provides tools and a methodology that
              organizations can implement to update to the latest version of ATT&CK, keeping their
              threat-informed defense timely and relevant to emerging threats. </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The Sensor Mappings to ATT&CK project provides a collection of resources to assist security
              operations teams and security leaders with understanding which tools, capabilities, and events
              can help provide visibility into real-world adversary behaviors potentially occurring in their
              environments. SMAP builds on MITRE ATT&CK速 Data Sources by connecting the conceptual data source
              representations of information that can be collected to concrete logs, sensors, and other security
              capabilities that provide that type of data. </p>
