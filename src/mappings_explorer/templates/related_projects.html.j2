         <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/" target="_blank">MITRE ATT&CK®</a>
         knowledge base to better understand cyber adversaries and their tradecraft in order to advance
         threat-informed defense. The following Center projects are most closely
         related to the security capability mappings projects presented in Mappings Explorer.

          <h4 class="title">Sensor Mappings to ATT&CK</h4>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Sensor Mappings to ATT&CK project provides a collection of resources to assist security
             operations teams and security leaders with understanding which tools, capabilities, and events
             can help provide visibility into real-world adversary behaviors potentially occurring in their
             environments. SMAP builds on MITRE ATT&CK® Data Sources by connecting the conceptual data source
             representations of information that can be collected to concrete logs, sensors, and other security
             capabilities that provide that type of data. </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The ATT&CK Sync project streamlines upgrades to new versions of MITRE ATT&CK® by providing tools
             and resources to migrate existing projects to current ATT&CK versions in a timely and efficient
             manner. The ATT&CK knowledge base is updated twice per year and with each new ATT&CK release,
             projects fall behind and become outdated. ATT&CK Sync provides tools and a methodology that
             organizations can implement to update to the latest version of ATT&CK, keeping their
             threat-informed defense timely and relevant to emerging threats. </p>
