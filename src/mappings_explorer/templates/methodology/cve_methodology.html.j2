            <h2>Using MITRE ATT&CK® to Describe Vulnerabilities</h2>
        </div>

        <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">ATT&CK</a> tactics and techniques can be used as a set of standard terms
            to describe the exploitation process of a vulnerability. For example, to exploit a vulnerability where
            credentials are sent in clear text, the following steps could be used:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sniff the network <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040/">T1040</a></li>
            <li>Which gets you the unsecured credentials <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/">T1552</a>
            </li>
            <li>Which you can use to access a valid account <a
                    href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/">T1078</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once the attacker has access to the valid account, there are too many paths they can take to list them all.
        </p>
        <p>When developing this methodology, we found that three steps in the attack is usually as far in the process as
            can be reasonably described. We categorize these steps in the following way:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Exploitation Technique</strong> - the method used to exploit the vulnerability (T1040 in the
                example).</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Impact</strong> - the initial benefit gained through exploitation of a vulnerability
                (T1552 in the example).</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Impact</strong> - what the adversary can do by gaining the benefit of the primary
                impact (T1078 in the example).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Using these three categories, you can create a vulnerability impact description template such as:</p>
        <blockquote>The vulnerability allows the attacker to use <em>[EXPLOITATION TECHNIQUE]</em> to gain <em>[Primary
                Impact]</em>, which leads to <em>[Secondary Impact]</em>.</blockquote>
        <img src="{{url_prefix}}static/img/cve_methodology.png" class="img-fluid"
        alt="Vulnerability allows exploitation technique which enables impact and leads to secondary impact">
        <p>ATT&CK will not always contain a technique for each of the categories. ATT&CK is written at a higher level of
            abstraction than is often used to describe a vulnerability and ATT&CK requires examples where the technique
            has been used in real-world attacks. For example, the primary impact of a vulnerability may be too low-level
            to include an ATT&CK technique. In which case, you can use the secondary impact in place of the primary or
            use one of the tactic-level techniques.</p>

            <h2><span class="highlight">Using</span> the Methodology</h2>
        </div>
        <p>We defined three methods to map ATT&CK techniques to vulnerabilities:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Vulnerability Type</strong> – This method groups vulnerabilities with common vulnerability types
                (e.g.,
                cross-site scripting and SQL injection) that have common technique mappings.</li>
            <li><strong>Functionality</strong> – This method groups common mappings based on the type of functionality
                the attacker gains
                access to by exploiting the vulnerability.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploit Technique</strong> – This method groups common mappings depending on the method used to
                exploit the
                vulnerability.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Only the vulnerability type method has mappings for all three categories. The functionality method has
            mappings for primary and secondary impacts. The exploit techniques method only has mappings for the
            exploitation technique categories.</p>
        <p><strong>Vulnerability Type Method</strong></p>
        <p>Vulnerabilities that have the same type often also have the same attack steps. This method maps ATT&CK
            techniques to some of the more common vulnerability types. CWE-699 (Software Development) and CWE-1000
            (Research Concepts) were used to select the vulnerability types, though the method sometimes creates its own
            high-level categories for the sake of brevity.</p>
        <p>The vulnerability type mappings can include the following technique categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Exploitation Technique</li>
            <li>Primary Impact</li>
            <li>Secondary Impact</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If one of these categories is not included in the mapping for a particular vulnerability type, use one of the
            other methods to find the appropriate techniques.</p>
        <p><strong>Functionality Method</strong></p>
        <p>For a vulnerability to be useful, it needs to provide the attacker with a capability they did not have
            before. Attackers are often trying to gain access to the same functionality and thus, many vulnerabilities
            can be grouped by functionality.</p>
        <p>This method includes the following technique categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Primary Impact</li>
            <li>Secondary Impact</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To find the exploitation technique for a vulnerability, use one of the other two mapping methods in this
            document.</p>
        <p><strong>Exploit Technique Method</strong></p>
        <p>This method groups techniques by the common steps taken to exploit a vulnerability. Use this method when a
            vulnerability type has too many possible exploitation scenarios to list in the Vulnerability Type method.
        </p>
        <p>This method includes the following technique categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Exploitation Technique</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To find the exploit technique for a vulnerability, use one of the other two mapping methods in this document.

            <h2><span class="highlight">Mapping & Methodology</span> Scope</h2>
        </div>
        <p>In each method there are cases where we have not included a mapping for all available categories
            (Exploitation Technique, Primary Impact, Secondary Impact). Technique mappings are only included for a
            category when it is likely that different vulnerabilities in the group share that technique. For example,
            vulnerabilities that modify memory (e.g., buffer overflows) share a common primary impact, but the secondary
            impacts and exploitation techniques are so varied that the methodology does not include a mapping for those
            categories.</p>
        <img src="{{url_prefix}}static/img/cve_example_1.png" class="img-fluid"
        alt="Vulnerability allows exploitation technique which enables impact and leads to what?">
        <p>Some groupings will have more than one technique listed for a mapping category because there are common
            variations within that grouping. In these cases, select only the techniques that apply to the vulnerability.
            For example, the cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability type includes an option of <a
                href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189">T1189 Drive-by
                Compromise</a> or <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001">T1204.001 User Execution:
                Malicious Link</a> depending on whether the attacked is stored or
            not.</p>
        <p>This methodology establishes a starting point for vulnerability reporters and researchers to standardize the
            way they describe some vulnerability data. The methodology does not cover all the ways that systems are
            exploited.</p>
        <p><strong>Example: <a
                    href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-17900">CVE-2018-17900</a></strong></p>
        <blockquote>Yokogawa STARDOM Controllers FCJ, FCN-100, FCN-RTU, FCN-500, All versions R4.10 and prior, The web
            application improperly protects credentials which could allow an attacker to obtain credentials for remote
            access to controllers.</blockquote>
        <p>To find the appropriate ATT&CK techniques, start by identifying the vulnerability type. For CVE-2018-17900,
            the vulnerability is a credential management issue. Looking through the list of vulnerability types in the
            methodology, the "General Credential Management Errors" vulnerability type appears to be the most
            appropriate. Using one of the lower-level credential management vulnerability types is preferable but the
            CVE record does not provide the level of detail need to do so.</p>
        <p>The ”General Credential Management Errors” vulnerability type maps to <a
                href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552">T1552 Unsecured Credentials</a> for the
            primary impact and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078">T1078 Valid Accounts</a> for the
            secondary impact. These mappings follow the description in
            the CVE record. “improperly protects credentials which could allow an attacker to obtain credentials”
            matches T1552 and “for remote access to controllers” matches T1078.</p>
        <p>The ”General Credential Management Errors” vulnerability type does not have a mapping for the exploitation
            technique because there are too many ways general credential management vulnerabilities can be exploited. To
            find the exploitation technique for CVE-2018-17900, use the Exploit Technique section. The Exploit Technique
            section documents a set of scenarios to help the user determine which exploitation technique(s) are
            appropriate for the vulnerability. For CVE-2018-17900, the entry point is the web application so the
            “Attacker exploits remote system application” scenario applies, which makes <a
                href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190">T1190 Exploit Public-Facing
                Application</a> the exploitation technique for the vulnerability.</p>
        <p>The description for CVE-2018-17900 can now be re-written using the ATT&CK standard.</p>

        <p>When the three methods above (Vulnerability Type, Functionality, and Exploit Technique) don't support mapping
            the exploit type or impacts of a vulnerability, consider focusing at a higher level in ATT&CK. For many
            tactics within ATT&CK, there is a generic exploitation technique. When mapping techniques to
            vulnerabilities, exploitation can be assumed so these techniques are not as useful in this context than for
            other uses of ATT&CK. In this document, where possible, a more specific technique is used over the generic
            exploitation techniques.</p>

        <h3>CVE-2020-6960</h3>
        <p><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6960">CVE-2020-6960</a> is a SQL injection vulnerability.
            The SQL injection listing the Vulnerability Type section contains mappings for the Primary Impact and
            Secondary Impact. For the Primary Impact, the mapping is <a
                href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059">T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter</a>. For the
            Secondary Impact, there are several options to choose from. Unfortunately, the CVE record does not provide
            enough information to choose a Secondary Impact.</p>
        <h3>CVE-2018-17900</h3>
        <p><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17900">CVE-2018-17900</a> is about insecure credential
            handling. The in "General Credential Management Errors" vulnerability type applies for this vulnerability.
            In this case, both mappings in the methodology apply. The Primary Impact is <a
                href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552">T1552 Unsecured Credentials</a>, when then leads to the
            Secondary Impact allowing the adversary to use <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078">T1078
                Valid Accounts</a>.</p>
        <h3>CVE-2020-11036</h3>
        <p><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11036">CVE-2020-11036</a> is a cross-site scripting (XSS)
            vulnerability. For XSS vulnerabilities, there are standard Primary Impact and Secondary Impact mappings
            (T1059.007 and T1185 respectively). However, the Exploitation Technique depends on what type of XSS
            vulnerability it is. Since CVE-2020-11036 is a stored XSS vulnerability, the mapping should be <a
                href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189">T1189 Drive-by Compromise</a>, as the attack is stored
            in the web page and the victims are attacked by visiting the infected web page.</p>
        <h3>CVE-2020-5210</h3>
        <p><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5210">CVE-2020-5210</a> is a buffer overflow. Since buffer
            overflows modify the memory, the "Memory Modification (Memory Buffer Errors, Pointer Issues, Type Errors,
            etc.)" vulnerability type is used, making the Primary Impacts <a
                href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574">T1574 Hijack Execution Flow</a> and <a
                href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/004">T1499.004 Endpoint Denial of Service: Application
                or System Exploitation</a>. The vulnerability also has an exploitation technique mapping of <a
                href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/001">T1548.001 Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Setuid
                and Setgid</a>. The methodology does not list T1548.001 as an exploitation technique because it is
            relatively rare.</p>
