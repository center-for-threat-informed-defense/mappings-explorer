            <h2><span class="highlight">Mapping</span> Overview</h2>
        </div>

        <p>The Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS) provides a common language for describing
            security incidents in a structured and repeatable manner. The overall goal is to lay a foundation from which
            cyber analysts can constructively and cooperatively learn to better measure and manage risk.</p>
        <p>VERIS employs a threat model with four primary axes, the "A4" model, to describe incidents. The four axes
            are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Actors:</strong> Whose actions affected the assets?</li>
            <li><strong>Actions:</strong> What actions affected the assets?</li>
            <li><strong>Assets:</strong> Which assets were affected?</li>
            <li><strong>Attributes:</strong> How were the assets affected?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each axis has a categorized set of values, called an enumeration, associated with it. Incidents are
            classified with one or more of those enumeration values for each axis. Examples of incidents mapped to VERIS
            can be seen in the VERIS Community Database. One other axis outside the 4A model is the Value Chain, which
            represents pre-attack activities. These activities are essential to a successful campaign and are very
            closely associated with an entire category of behavior.</p>
        <p>In this document, VERIS enumeration values follow the form [Axis].[Category].[Subcategory].[Value]; for
            example, Action.Malware.Variety.C2 corresponds to the C2 value in the Action axis, Malware category, Variety
            subcategory.</p>
        <p>MITRE ATT&CKÂ® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world
            observations. ATT&CK focuses on how external adversaries compromise and operate within computer information
            networks. ATT&CK describes adversary behaviors using the following core components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tactics:</strong> "why" - the adversary's objective or reason for performing an action</li>
            <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> "how" - the means by which adversaries achieve tactical goals</li>
            <li><strong>Sub-techniques:</strong> describing more specific means by which adversaries achieve tactical
                goals at a lower level than techniques</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Adversary behaviors can be described by mapping them to the appropriate tactics, techniques, and
            sub-techniques in ATT&CK.</p>
        <p>The 2021 mapping project took enumeration values in VERIS and mapped them to ATT&CK Enterprise Techniques.
            The resultant mappings could be used to either take a VERIS enumeration value and come up with a list of
            ATT&CK techniques and sub-techniques, or to take an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique and come up with a
            list of VERIS enumeration values.</p>
        <p>The 2023 update to the mapping project continues the work of the original integration project by updating and
            expanding the mapping and translation layer between VERIS and ATT&CK to enhance the community's ability to
            pivot from VERIS to ATT&CK Techniques related to a particular incident. In addition, the documentation has
            been updated and expanded to provide updated use cases and new scenario examples that further demonstrate
            how the mappings can support describing and communicating information about security incidents.</p>

        <p>Note that some VERIS axes and enumeration values cannot be mapped cleanly to ATT&amp;CK; therefore this
            project maps onto a subset of the axes and enumerations as detailed here.</p>

        <h3>Action Axis Scope</h3>
        <p>Within each of the axes that describe adversary behaviors, the scope is further narrowed based on whether the
            adversary behaviors for a particular enumeration category align to ATT&CK. For example, ATT&CK does not
            cover unintentional errors or natural disasters and therefore the Error and Environmental enumeration
            categories in the Action axis are not mapped. </p>

        <p>Based on those scoping decisions, the mappings were created by analyzing each in-scope ATT&CK
            technique/sub-technique and each in-scope VERIS enumeration value. VERIS and ATT&CK are at different levels
            of abstraction and cannot always perfectly describe the adversary behaviors that they are meant to
            represent. Some amount of analyst judgment is required, and whenever judgment is involved, there can be
            differences of opinion. These design decisions document our judgement and rationale.</p>

            <h2><span class="highlight">Guiding Principles</span> and Design Decisions</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Mappings are many-to-many:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>VERIS enumeration values may describe multiple adversary behaviors. Values are mapped to all relevant
                techniques and sub-techniques.</li>
            <li>ATT&CK techniques and sub-techniques may describe a behavior that is also described by multiple VERIS
                enumeration values. Techniques are mapped to all relevant values.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>VERIS enumeration values are mapped to the most specific ATT&CK entity that applies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the VERIS enumeration value describes a behavior that maps to a sub-technique, it is mapped to that
                sub-technique.</li>
            <li>If the VERIS enumeration value describes a behavior that maps to a technique, it is mapped to that
                technique and all sub-techniques.</li>
            <li>If the VERIS enumeration value describes a behavior that maps to a tactic, it is mapped to all
                techniques and sub-techniques in that tactic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>ATT&CK techniques are considered in the context of their descriptions and adversary goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In some cases, techniques that appear to describe the same technical behavior are not mapped because the
                adversary objective differs from that described by the VERIS enumeration value.</li>
            <li>Many adversary behaviors are described by both Action.Hacking and Action.Malware:</li>
            <li>Activities in the VERIS Action.Hacking category are those performed by hands-on-keyboard attackers.</li>
            <li>Activities in the VERIS Action.Malware category are automated by software/malware.</li>
            <li>ATT&CK techniques and sub-techniques will be mapped to one or both depending on if they describe
                behaviors that are always automated, always manual, or might be either.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any remaining [sub-]techniques are mapped to one of these:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Action.Hacking.Variety.Other</li>
            <li>Action.Hacking.Vector.Other</li>
            <li>Action.Malware.Variety.Other</li>
            <li>Action.Malware.Vector.Other</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any techniques that have unspecified components of adversary behavior are mapped to one of these:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Action.Hacking.Variety.Unknown</li>
            <li>Action.Malware.Variety.Unknown</li>
