            <h2>Mapping Methodology</h2>
        </div>

        <p>This document describes the methodology used to map security control frameworks to MITRE ATT&CK®. While the
            methodology is based upon our experience mapping NIST Special Publication 800-53 to ATT&CK, the methodology
            was designed to be easily tailored and applied to other security control frameworks. Mapping security
            control frameworks to ATT&CK provides a powerful way for organizations to see their security control
            coverage against associated ATT&CK techniques and establishes a means to integrate ATT&CK-based threat
            information within the risk management process.</p>
        <p>MITRE ATT&CK is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world
            observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base represents adversary goals as tactics and the specific behaviors to
            achieve those goals (how) as techniques and sub-techniques. ATT&CK's Mitigation structure represents
            security concepts and classes of tools that may prevent successful execution of a set of techniques or
            sub-techniques.<sup><a
                    href="https://attack.mitre.org/docs/ATTACK_Design_and_Philosophy_March_2020.pdf">[1]</a></sup> The
            methodology described below leverages the information in the ATT&CK knowledge base
            and its underlying data model to create context that is then used to select security controls to map to a
            given technique or sub-technique.</p>
        <p>Much like an ATT&CK mitigation, a mapping between a security control and an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique
            means that the security control may prevent successful execution of the technique or sub-technique. This
            methodology does not define degrees of mapping or control effectiveness. Controls are either mapped or not
            mapped to a given technique or sub-technique. In this way the mappings provide an easily understood
            foundational resource that is intended to inform risk management decisions.</p>
        <p>ATT&CK’s mitigations are at the core of this methodology and act as a bridge helping to connect adversary
            behavior (tactics and techniques) to the security controls that mitigate those behaviors. The methodology
            defines an iterative process that consists of four main steps. Each step incrementally builds understanding
            allowing the analyst to understand ATT&CK techniques and sub-techniques in the context of a mitigation and
            then select relevant security controls to map. The four steps are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>ATT&CK Mitigation Review</strong> &mdash; Reviewing and analyzing each mitigation.
            <li><strong>ATT&CK Technique Review</strong> &mdash; Understanding adversary objectives and goals a
                technique or
                sub-technique is designed to carry out.
            <li><strong>Security Control Review</strong> &mdash; Examining security controls in the context of the
                mitigation
                and specific technique.
            <li><strong>Create a Mapping</strong> &mdash; Identifying and creating security control mappings to ATT&CK
                technique
                and sub-techniques.

            <h2><span class="highlight">Step 1:</span> ATT&CK Mitigation Review</h2>
        </div>
        <p>ATT&CK’s mitigations describe security concepts and classes of tools that may prevent successful execution of
            a set of techniques or sub-techniques. Studying these mitigations provides concepts and technologies to
            consider as part of ensuring that relevant and applicable security controls are identified. Understanding
            the specific context of what a given mitigation is preventing and how a mitigation is associated with or
            applies to a technique or sub-technique guides the security control analysis and initial selection of
            candidate security controls.</p>
        <p>As an example, consider the ATT&CK mitigation for Credential Access Protection ID: <a
                href="https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1043/">M1043</a>. This mitigation
            describes a broad class of capabilities that prevent credential access and credential dumping. M1043 then
            identifies several techniques and sub-techniques that could be prevented by this class of security
            capabilities. Due to the generally abstract nature of mitigations in ATT&CK, it is common to find that there
            is more detailed guidance for each technique or sub-technique to which the mitigation is applied.</p>

            <h2><span class="highlight">Step 2:</span> ATT&CK Technique Review</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The next step of the security control mapping methodology involves examining each technique and sub-technique
            that the mitigation under review applies to. Each technique and sub-technique must be considered
            independently as there may be important differences among them that result in different security control
            mappings. Understanding what the adversary's goal (tactic) and how (technique) they achieve that goal helps
            to refine our understanding of the mitigation and builds context as we prepare to study relevant security
            controls. ATT&CK techniques and sub-techniques provide relevant information such as domain specific and
            platform specific information, configuration concepts, and tools.</p>
        <p>For example, a specific technique addressed by M1043 Credential Access Protection is OS Credential Dumping
            ID: <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003">T1003</a>. This technique is used by adversaries
            attempting to dump credentials to obtain account login and
            credential material, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password, from the operating system and
            software. There is also a more specific behavior under this technique related to M1043, the sub-technique
            LSASS Memory ID: <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001">T1003.001</a>. This sub-technique
            involves adversary attempts to access credential material
            stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS).</p>

            <h2><span class="highlight">Step 3:</span> Security Control Review</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Next, it is necessary to understand and identify the security concepts and technologies that can be used to
            prevent a given action from being successfully executed. For each technique or sub-technique examined in the
            previous step, the context of the mitigation under review is applied as security controls are examined. For
            each security control, determine if it is aligned with the intent of the mitigation under review and if it
            is relevant to the technique or sub-technique under review.</p>
        <p>For example, technique T1003 OS Credential Dumping and sub-technique T1003.001 LSASS Memory can be mapped to
            preventative concepts and technologies provided by NIST 800-53 security control families of Access Control
            (AC), Configuration Management (CM), Risk Assessment (RA), and System and Information Integrity (SI).
            Additional contextual information provided identifies specific controls mapped to T1003 and T1003.01: AC-3
            and AC-4 for Access Flow Enforcement and Information Flow Enforcement, CM-2 Baseline Configuration and CM-6
            Configuration Settings, RA-5 for Vulnerability Scanning, and SI-4 for System Monitoring.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The previous three steps of the methodology provide the analytical context to identify a list of candidate
            security controls. Once this candidate list of security controls has been identified, it is further
            reviewed, analyzed, and tailored in line with the control mapping scoping decisions to fully determine
            matches to techniques and/or sub-techniques. When this is completed, the security control selection is
            finalized and the mappings are created and associated with the specific technique or sub-technique.</p>
        <p>To continue with the example, further review and analysis confirms the identified control selection and the
            mappings can be created for the technique T1003 OS Credential Dumping and sub-technique T1003.001 LSASS
            Memory. The resultant mappings are listed below:</p>
