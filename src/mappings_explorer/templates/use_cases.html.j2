                        to understand the details of adversary activities, thus creating a fingerprint of the event.

                        context
                        of this website, mapped “coverage” of a set of techniques does not mean complete protection,
                        but
                        rather that the given controls provide some mitigation against the successful execution of
                        the
                        mapped techniques. The mappings support the CISO/ISSM in reviewing the adequacy of risk and
                        gaps
                        in overall threat defense; and identify which additional security controls are needed to
                        mitigate cyber attacks.

                        The mappings provide an overview of existing cyber defensive coverage of categorized against
                        adversarial behaviors. Gaps in security capability coverage and entry points can then be
                        measured and assessed to determine what additional coverage is needed to mitigate threats.
                        This
