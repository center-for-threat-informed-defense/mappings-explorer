description: >
  AWS CloudWatch monitors resources, applications, and services to collect and track metrics in
  real-time. These metrics provide visibility into resource utilization, performance, and health.
  AWS CloudWatch integrates with over 70 AWS services including Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon
  ECS among others.

          AWS CloudWatch provides various metrics including CPU utilization, connections, disk
          space, memory, bytes sent/received, and the number of running containers among others. The
          following metrics (not an exhaustive list) could be used to detect if the usage of a
          resource has increased such as when an adversary hijacks a resource to perform intensive
          tasks.

          Linux/Mac OS
          -------------
          cpu_time_active
          cpu_time_guest
          cpu_usage_active
          cpu_usage_guest
          disk_free
          disk_total
          disk_used
          ethtool_bw_in_allowance_exceeded
          ethtool_bw_out_allowance_exceeded
          ethtool_conntrack_allowance_exceeded
          mem_active
          mem_available_percent
          mem_free
          net_bytes_recv
          net_bytes_sent
          net_packets_sent
          net_packets_recv
          netstat_tcp_established
          netstat_tcp_listen
          processes_running
          processes_total
          swap_free
          swap_used

          Containers
          ----------
          CpuUtilized
          MemoryUtilized
          NetworkRxBytes
          NetworkTxBytes
          node_cpu_usage_total
          node_cpu_utilization
          node_filesystem_utilization
          node_memory_utilization

          This mapping is given a score of Partial because it is not possible to differentiate
          between an authorized and unauthorized increase in resource utilization.

          AWS CloudWatch provides various metrics including CPU utilization, connections, disk
          space, memory, bytes sent/received, and the number of running containers among others. The
          following metric could be used to detect if an adversary deployed a new container in the
          environment. 

          node_number_of_running_containers

          This mapping is given a score of Partial because it is not possible to differentiate
          between an authorized and unauthorized deployment of a new container.  
  - id: T1040
    name: Network Sniffing
    technique-scores:
      - category: Protect
        value: Significant
        comments: >-
          AWS CloudWatch uses TLS/SSL connections to communicate with other AWS resources which
          protects against network sniffing attacks. As a result, this mapping is given a score of
          Significant.
