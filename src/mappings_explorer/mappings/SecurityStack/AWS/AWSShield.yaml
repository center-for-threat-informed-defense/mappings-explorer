description: >-
  AWS Shield is a service that protects against Distributed Denial of Service attacks. There are two
  tiers for this service Standard and Advanced.

  AWS Shield Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport (Layer
  3 and 4 attacks) layer DDoS attacks that target your web site or applications.

  AWS Shield Advanced adds on to standard by providing additional detection and mitigation against
  large and sophisticated DDoS attacks. There is near real-time visibility into attacks. AWS Shield
  Advanced also comes with 24x7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT).

              AWS Shield will set and use a static network flow threshold to detect incoming traffic
              to AWS services. This will reduce direct network DOS attacks by applying an
              undisclosed combination of traffic signatures, anomaly algorithms, and other analysis
              techniques to detect malicious traffic in real-time. AWS Shield Advance identifies
              anomalies in network traffic to flag attempted attacks and execute inline mitigations
              to resolve the issue.

              AWS Shield Standard provides protection and response to these Denial of Service
              attacks in real time by using a network traffic baseline and identifying anomalies
              among other techniques.

              AWS Shield Advance allows for customized detection and mitigations for custom
              applications that are running on EC2 instances.
comments: >-
  There is not much documentation that lends itself useful to scoring the accuracy of this
  control although offerings such as Shield Advanced protection groups and the AWS Shield Response Team (SRT)
  can be leveraged to improve the accuracy of this control. The control states that DDOS attacks can be mitigated
  in real time (temporal factor) and not increase cause latency for impacted services.
