          This control may protect against malicious use of cloud accounts but may not mitigate
          exploitation of local, domain, or default accounts present within deployed resources.

              This control may protect against malicious use of cloud accounts by implementing
              service control policies that define what actions an account may take. If best
              practices are followed, AWS accounts should only have the least amount of privileges
              required.

              This control may protect against cloud account discovery by segmenting accounts into
              separate organizational units and restricting to least privileges between groups.

          This control may protect against cloud infrastructure discovery by segmenting accounts
          into separate organizational units and restricting infrastructure access by least

          This control may protect against cloud service dashboard abuse by segmenting accounts into
          separate organizational units and restricting dashboard access by least privilege.
