              The following AWS Config managed rules can identify configuration problems that should
              be fixed in order to ensure SSL/TLS encryption is enabled to protect network traffic:
              "acm-certificate-expiration-check" for nearly expired certificates in AWS Certificate
              Manager (ACM); "alb-http-to-https-redirection-check" for Application Load Balancer
              (ALB) HTTP listeners; "api-gw-ssl-enabled" for API Gateway REST API stages;
              "cloudfront-custom-ssl-certificate", "cloudfront-sni-enabled", and
              "cloudfront-viewer-policy-https", for Amazon CloudFront distributions;

              Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) Classic Load Balancer listeners;
              "redshift-require-tls-ssl" for Amazon Redshift cluster connections to SQL clients;

              node-to-node communications.

              All of these are run on configuration changes except
              "alb-http-to-https-redirection-check", which is run periodically. Coverage factor is
              partial for these rules, since they are specific to a subset of the available AWS

          The following AWS Config managed rules can identify configuration problems that should be
          fixed in order to ensure that private traffic is routed securely and only within VPCs
          rather than on the public Internet: "api-gw-endpoint-type-check" for Amazon API Gateway
          APIs, "elasticsearch-in-vpc-only" for Amazon ElasticSearch Service domains, and
          "redshift-enhanced-vpc-routing-enabled" for Amazon Redshift cluster traffic.

              The "eks-endpoint-no-public-access" managed rule can identify whether Amazon Elastic
              Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) endpoints are misconfigured to allow public endpoint
              access, which should be fixed in order to prevent malicious external access to the

          The "ec2-managedinstance-applications-blacklisted" managed rule verifies that a
          pre-defined list of applications are not installed on specified managed instances. It can
          be used to identify the presence of vulnerable applications (prompting removal before they
          can be exploited) and/or to identify the presence of allowed packages below a minimum
          version (prompting updates before they can be exploited). The
          "ec2-managedinstance-platform-check" managed rule verifies that managed instances are
          running desired platform types, including using a desired version (as opposed to an
          out-of-date one). Both can reduce instances' attack surface for adversary exploitation,
          including for privilege escalation.

          The "ecs-task-definition-user-for-host-mode-check" managed rule can identify Amazon
          Elastic Container Service (ECS) task definitions for containers with host networking mode
          and 'privileged' or 'user' container definitions, which may enable adversaries to break
          out of containers and gain access to the underlying host, increasing their access and
          privileges.

          All of these are run on configuration changes. Coverage factor is partial for these rules,
          since they are specific to a subset of the available AWS services and will only protect
          against certain forms of identifiable exploitation, resulting in an overall score of
          Partial.

              The following AWS Config managed rules can identify configuration problems that should
              be fixed in order to ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled properly,
              which can provide protection against attempted misuse of cloud accounts:
              "iam-user-mfa-enabled", "mfa-enabled-for-iam-console-access",
              "root-account-hardware-mfa-enabled", and "root-account-mfa-enabled". All of these
              controls are run periodically.

              The following AWS Config managed rules can identify configuration problems that should
              be fixed in order to ensure that appropriate AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
              policies are in place to enforce fine-grained access policies and mitigate the impact
              of compromised valid accounts: "iam-customer-policy-blocked-kms-actions",
              "iam-inline-policy-blocked-kms-actions", "iam-no-inline-policy-check",
              "iam-group-has-users-check", "iam-policy-blacklisted-check",
              "iam-policy-no-statements-with-admin-access",
              "iam-policy-no-statements-with-full-access", "iam-role-managed-policy-check",
              "iam-user-group-membership-check", "iam-user-no-policies-check", and
              "ec2-instance-profile-attached" are run on configuration changes.
              "iam-password-policy", "iam-policy-in-use", "iam-root-access-key-check",
              "iam-user-mfa-enabled", "iam-user-unused-credentials-check", and
              "mfa-enabled-for-iam-console-access" are run periodically. The "access-keys-rotated"
              managed rule ensures that IAM access keys are rotated at an appropriate rate.

              Given that these rules provide robust coverage for a variety of IAM configuration
              problems and most are evaluated on configuration changes, they result in an overall
              score of Significant.

              The following AWS Config managed rules can identify configuration problems that should
              be fixed in order to ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled properly,
              which can significantly impede brute force authentication attempts by requiring
              adversaries to provide a second form of authentication even if they succeed in
              brute forcing a password via one of these sub-techniques: "iam-user-mfa-enabled",
              "mfa-enabled-for-iam-console-access", "root-account-hardware-mfa-enabled", and
              "root-account-mfa-enabled".

              The "iam-password-policy" managed rule can identify insufficient password requirements
              that should be fixed in order to make brute force authentication more difficult by
              increasing the complexity of user passwords and decreasing the amount of time before
              they are rotated, giving adversaries less time to brute force passwords and making it
              more time consuming and resource intensive to do so. This is especially important in
              the case of Password Cracking, since adversaries in possession of password hashes may
              be able to recover usable credentials more quickly and do so without generating
              detectable noise via invalid login attempts.

              All of these controls are run periodically, but implemented policies are enforced
              continuously once set and coverage factor is significant, resulting in an overall
              score of Significant.

          The following AWS Config managed rules can identify configuration problems that should be

          attempts to automate collection within cloud environments: "ec2-ebs-encryption-by-default"
          which is run periodically and "encrypted-volumes" which is run on configuration changes.

          Coverage factor is minimal for these rules, since they are specific to EBS volumes and
          will only prevent certain forms of collection since adversaries with access to mounted
          volumes may be able to decrypt their contents, resulting in an overall score of Minimal.

          The following AWS Config managed rules can identify configuration problems that should be
          fixed in order to ensure that applications intended for internal use cannot be accessed
          externally for exploitation: "api-gw-endpoint-type-check" can ensure that Amazon API
          Gateway APIs are private and can only be accessed from within VPCs,
          "elasticsearch-in-vpc-only" can ensure that Amazon ElasticSearch Service (Amazon ES)
          domains are in the same VPC and the domain endpoint is not public,
          "lambda-function-public-access-prohibited" can verify that AWS Lambda functions are not
          publicly available, and "ec2-instance-no-public-ip" can verify whether EC2 instances have
          public IP addresses.

          The following AWS Config managed rules can identify configuration problems that should be
          fixed in order to ensure that insecure applications are not installed and installed
          packages are kept updated, reducing the likelihood of adversary exploitation: the
          "ec2-managedinstance-applications-blacklisted" managed rule verifies that a pre-defined
          list of applications are not installed on specified managed instances. It can be used to
          identify the presence of vulnerable applications (prompting removal before they can be
          exploited) and/or to identify the presence of allowed packages below a minimum version
          (prompting updates before they can be exploited). The "ec2-managedinstance-platform-check"
          managed rule verifies that managed instances are running desired platform types, including
          using a desired version (as opposed to an out-of-date one). Both can reduce instances'
          attack surface for adversary exploitation. "rds-automatic-minor-version-upgrade-enabled"
          can verify that Amazon RDS is being patched, and
          "elastic-beanstalk-managed-updates-enabled" can verify that Elastic Beanstalk is being
          patched.

          Coverage factor is partial for these rules, since they are specific to a subset of the
          available AWS services that can be used to host public-facing applications and will only
          protect against certain forms of identifiable exploitation, resulting in an overall score
          of Partial.

          The following AWS Config managed rules can identify configuration problems that should be

              The "ec2-managedinstance-applications-required" managed rule verifies that all
              applications in a pre-defined list of requirements are installed on specified managed
              instances, and is run on configuration changes. It will not detect modification to
              those applications, but will detect if they are uninstalled. The
              "ec2-managedinstance-applications-blacklisted" managed rule verifies that a
              pre-defined list of applications are not installed on specified managed instances, and
              can be used to detect installation of applications below a minimum version, which can
              identify adversary attempts to downgrade required tools to insecure or ineffective
              older versions. Given the host-based scoping of this technique, coverage is partial,
              resulting in an overall score of Partial.

              The following AWS Config managed rules can identify potentially malicious changes to
              cloud firewall status and ensure that a WAF is enabled and enforcing specified ACLs:
              "lab-waf-enabled" for Application Load Balancers; "api-gw-associated-with-waf" for
              Amazon API Gateway API stages; "cloudfront-associated-with-waf" for Amazon CloudFront
              distributions; "fms-webacl-resource-policy-check", "fms-webacl-resource-policy-check",
              and "fms-webacl-rulegroup-association-check" for AWS Firewall Manager;
              "vpc-default-security-group-closed", "vpc-network-acl-unused-check", and
              "vpc-sg-open-only-to-authorized-ports" for VPC security groups; and
              "ec2-security-group-attached-to-eni" for EC2 and ENI security groups; all of which are
              run on configuration changes.

              The following AWS Config managed rules can identify specific configuration changes to
              VPC configuration that may suggest malicious modification to bypass protections:
              "internet-gateway-authorized-vpc-only" can identify Internet gateways (IGWs) attached
              to unauthorized VPCs, which can allow unwanted communication between a VPC and the
              Internet; "lambda-inside-vpc" can identify VPCs that have granted execution access to
              unauthorized Lambda functions; "service-vpc-endpoint-enabled" can verify that
              endpoints are active for the appropriate services across VPCs;
              "subnet-auto-assign-public-ip-disabled" checks for public IP addresses assigned to
              subnets within VPCs.

              Coverage factor is significant for these rules, since they cover firewall
              configuration for and via a wide range of services, resulting in an overall score of
              Significant.

          The "ecs-task-definition-user-for-host-mode-check" managed rule can identify Amazon
          Elastic Container Service (ECS) task definitions for containers with host networking mode
          and 'privileged' or 'user' container definitions, which may enable adversaries to break
          out of containers and gain access to the underlying host. It is run on configuration

  Mappings are based on the set of AWS managed rules provided by AWS Config, which are predefined
  rules that AWS Config uses to test for compliance with common best practices.

  AWS Config rules can be set to one of two types, "configuration changes" and "periodic", which are
  evaluated upon configuration changes and at a user-defined period, respectively.
