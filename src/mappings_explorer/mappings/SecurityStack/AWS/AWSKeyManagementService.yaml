description: >-
  AWS Key Management Service (KMS) allows you to create and manage cryptographic keys and control
  their usage across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications. It uses hardware security modules
  that have been validated under FIPS 140-2.

          This control's protection is specific to a minority of this technique's sub-techniques and
          procedure examples resulting in a Minimal Coverage score and consequently an overall score
          of Minimal.

              This service provides a more secure alternative to storing encryption keys in the file system.
              As a result of this service only supporting cryptographic keys and not other types of credentials,
              the coverage score is assessed as Partial resulting in an overall Partial score.

            comments: >-
              This service allows for securely storing encryption keys and enforcing fine-grained access to the keys.
              The service does not allow anyone access to retrieve plaintext keys from the service.

          Provides protection against sub-techniques involved with stealing credentials, certificates, and keys from
          the organization. As documented, access can be provisioned and monitored.

              The encryption key for the certificate can be stored in KMS, reducing its attack surface. Score is capped at
              Partial because adversaries can still misuse keys/certs if KMS and KMS resources are compromised.
