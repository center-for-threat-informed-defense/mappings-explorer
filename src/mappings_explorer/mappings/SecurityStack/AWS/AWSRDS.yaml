  AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) is a service that simplifies the setup, operation, and
  scaling of relational databases in AWS. AWS RDS manages backups, software patching, automatic
  failure detection, and recovery of databases. AWS RDS supports MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle,
  and Microsoft SQL Server instances.

          AWS RDS supports the encryption of database instances using the AES-256 encryption
          algorithm. This can protect database instances from being modified at rest. Furthermore,
          AWS RDS supports TLS/SSL connections which protect data from being modified during
          transit. This mapping is given a score of Partial because it only supports a subset of the
          sub-techniques (2 of 3).

          AWS RDS supports the replication and recovery of database instances. In the event that
          data is manipulated, AWS RDS can be used to restore the database instance to a previous
          point in time. As a result, this mapping is given a score of Significant.

          AWS RDS supports the automatic patching of minor versions of database instances. This can
          result in security flaws in the database instances being fixed before they can be
          exploited. This mapping is given a score of Partial because it does not protect against
          misconfigured database instances which may be susceptible to exploitation.

          AWS RDS provides deletion protection which prevents any user from deleting a database
          instance. If applied, the setting may mitigate attempts to delete a database instance. As

          AWS RDS supports the replication and recovery of database instances. In the event that a
          database instance is encrypted by an adversary (e.g., ransomware), AWS RDS can be used to

          AWS RDS supports the encryption of the underlying storage for database instances, backups,
          read replicas, and snapshots using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. This can protect
          against an adversary from gaining access to a database instance in the event they get
          access to the underlying system where the database instance is hosted or to S3 where the
          backups are stored. Furthermore, with AWS RDS, there is a setting that specifies whether
          or not a database instances is publicly accessible. When public accessibility is turned
          off, the database instance will not be available outside the VPC in which it was created.
          As a result, this mapping is given a score of Significant.
