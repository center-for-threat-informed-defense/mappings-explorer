description: >-
  AWS Certificate Manager is an Amazon service that supports the creation, storage, and renewal of
  public and private SSL/TLS X.509 certificates and keys that protect AWS websites and applications.
techniques: []
comments: >-
  This control was not mapped because AWS Certificate Manager simply issues certificates for use in
  other AWS services such as Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Elastic Beanstalk,
  Amazon API Gateway, AWS Nitro Enclaves, and AWS CloudFormation. It does not inherently protect
  against any ATT&CK techniques as it cannot be used to deploy certificates to other AWS services.
  That must be done either manually or with services integrated into AWS Certificate Manager.
