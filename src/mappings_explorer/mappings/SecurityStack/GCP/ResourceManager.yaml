  Google Cloud Platform provides resource containers such as organizations, folders, and projects
  that allow users to group and hierarchically organize other GCP resources. This hierarchical
  organization lets users easily manage common aspects of your resources such as access control and
  configuration settings. Resource Manager enables users to programmatically manage these resource
  containers.

          Resource Manager can easily modify your Cloud Identity and Access Management policies for
          your organization and folders, and the changes will apply across all the projects and
          resources. Create and manage IAM access control policies for your organization and
          projects. This control may prevent adversaries that try to discover resources by placing a
          limit on discovery of these resources with least privilege.

          GCP allows configuration of account policies to enable logging and IAM permissions and
          roles that may detect compromised user attempts to discover infrastructure and resources.

          An adversary may disable cloud logging capabilities and integrations to limit what data is
          collected on their activities and avoid detection. GCP allows configuration of account
          policies to enable logging and IAM permissions and roles to determine your ability to
          access audit logs data in Google Cloud resources.

          This control adopts the security principle of least privilege, which grants necessary
          access to user's resources when justified and needed. This control manages access control
          and ensures proper user permissions are in place to prevent adversaries that try to modify
          and/or disable firewall.

          Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of cloud accounts that are created and configured
          by an organization or admin. IAM audit logging in GCP can be used to determine roles and
          permissions, along with routinely checking user permissions to ensure only the expected
          users have the ability to list IAM identities or otherwise discover cloud accounts.

          Google Cloud Platform provides resource containers such as organizations, folders, and
          projects that allow one to group and hierarchically organize other GCP resources. This
          control may mitigate by denying direct remote access to internal systems through the use
          of network proxies, gateways, and firewalls from adversaries that may attempt to discover
          containers and other resources that are available within a containers environment.

        comments: >-
          To control access to resources, GCP requires that accounts making API requests have
          appropriate IAM roles. IAM roles include permissions that allow users to perform specific
          actions on Google Cloud resources. This control may mitigate adversaries that gather
          credentials via APIs within a containers environment. Since this covers only one of the
          sub-techniques, it is given a Minimal scoring.

          GCP offers Identity and Access Management (IAM), which lets admins give more granular
          access to specific Google Cloud resources and prevents unwanted access to other resources.
          This allows configuration of access controls and firewalls to limit access to critical
          systems and domain controllers.
