          Multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods, such as SMS, can also be used to help protect
          user accounts from phishing attacks. MFA provides significant protection against password
          compromises, requiring the adversary to complete an additional authentication method
          before their access is permitted.

          Identity Platform multi-tenancy uses tenants to create unique silos of users and
          configurations within a single Identity Platform project. It provides provides secure,
          easy-to-use authentication if you're building a service on Google Cloud, on your own
          backend or on another platform; thereby, helping to mitigate adversaries from gaining
          access to systems.

          Identity Platform integrates tightly with Google Cloud services, and it leverages industry
          standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, so it can be easily integrated with your
          custom backend. This control may mitigate application access token theft if the
          application is configured to retrieve temporary security credentials using an IAM role.

          Identity Platform provides Admin APIs to manage  users and authentication tokens. To
          prevent unwanted access to your users and tokens through these APIs, Identity Platform
          leverages IAM to manage permission to specific Identity Platform APIs. This control will
          ensure proper process and file permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from
          disabling or interfering with security/logging services.
