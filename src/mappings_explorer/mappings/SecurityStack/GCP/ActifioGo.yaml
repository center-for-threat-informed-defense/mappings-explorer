          Actifio is a copy data management plaform that virtualizes application data to improve an
          organizations resiliency and cloud mobility. Actifio allows an organization to take
          regular backups and provides several methods of restoring applications and/or VM data to a
          previous state. This provide significant capability to respond to Data Manipulation since
          an organization could restore manipulated data back to the latest backup.

        value: Minimal

          Actifio provides encryption in transit for data traveling between Actifio appliances,
          Actifio and VMware environments, and for data traversing the control channel utilizing the
          Actifio connector. This provides significant protection against Network Sniffing since
          adversaries would be unable to read encrypted traffic. However, Actifio only encrypts data
          in transit that interacts with Actifio components, rather than all traffic for a system.
          This is also only relevant when traffic is being backed up, which is a small amount of the
          time. In this case, it has been given a rating of Minimal.

      - category: Protect
        value: Partial
        comments: >-
          Actifio Sky can be configured with optional storage pool encryption. Administrative
          end-user credentials are hashed with a strong one-way salted SHA256 hash in the appliance
          database. Credentials used by the appliance to access other systems (vCenters, databases,) are stored in an AES256 encrypted form. This provides significant protection against
          adversaries searching compromised Actifio systems for insecurely stored credentials.
          However, this does not provide protection for other credentials stored on non-Actifio
          components. This has resulted in a score of partial.

          Actifio uses two command line (CLI) interfaces for customer end-users and Actifio support
          personnel. All CLI access is via key based authentication only. This provides significant
          protection against brute force password attacks. However, this only provides protection
          for Actifio components, rather than all components for a system. This has resulted in a
          score of Partial.
