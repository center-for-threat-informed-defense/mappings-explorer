    score-comment: 'GuardDuty provides multiple finding types that flag malicious
      activity against resources. These findings focus on API calls that look suspicious
      and although they do not flag events such as Defacement specifically, it can
      be inferred that these findings can result in mitigating this technique''s negative
      impact. With this assumption the score is capped at Partial. '
