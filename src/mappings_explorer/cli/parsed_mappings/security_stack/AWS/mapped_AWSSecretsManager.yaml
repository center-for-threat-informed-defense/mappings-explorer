    score-comment: This control may prevent harvesting of credentials from password
      stores by providing a secure, finely controlled location for secrets storage.
      This control is only relevant for credentials that would be used from application
      and configuration files and not those entered directly by an end user.

      by removing credentials and secrets from applications that can be exploited
