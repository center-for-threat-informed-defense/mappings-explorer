    comments: There is not much documentation that lends itself useful to scoring
      the accuracy of this control although offerings such as Shield Advanced protection
      groups and the AWS Shield Response Team (SRT) can be leveraged to improve the
      accuracy of this control. The control states that DDOS attacks can be mitigated
      in real time (temporal factor) and not increase cause latency for impacted services.
