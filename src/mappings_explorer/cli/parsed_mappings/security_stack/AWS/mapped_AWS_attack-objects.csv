It should be noted that not all managed insights have the level of detail to be able to map them to ATT&CK techniques and are not included in the mapping (e.g., ""EC2 instances involved in known Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)""). 
AWS Config: AWS Security Hub supports reporting on findings from AWS Config (e.g., for CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark controls among others). Given that AWS Config is its own service, these findings will not be mapped to ATT&CK. The only controls that will be included in this mapping  are those for which Security Hub implements custom logic. It should also be noted that there will  be a future CTID project that maps specific CIS Benchmarks to ATT&CK techniques.
