    score-comment: AWS S3 may protect against data destruction through application
      of several best practices. Multi-factor authentication can be enabled for delete
      operations and for changing the versioning state of a bucket. Versioning can
      be enabled to revert objects to a previous state after malicious destruction
      or corruption. S3 Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or
      overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.  In addition, S3 Cross
      Region Replication can be used to replicate S3 buckets to another AWS region
      for add protection.

    score-comment: S3 provides full control of access via Identity and Access Management
      (IAM) policies and with its access control lists (ACLs). The S3 Block Public
      Access feature allows for policies limiting public access to Amazon S3 resources
      that are enforced regardless of how the resources are created or associated
      IAM policies. Server-side encryption can be enabled for data at rest and allows
      for use of S3-managed keys, AWS Key Management Service managed keys, or customer-provided
      keys.
