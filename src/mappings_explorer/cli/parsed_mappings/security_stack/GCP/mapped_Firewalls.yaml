      Google Cloud Firewalls could block the source of the denial-of-service attack.
      This mapping is given a score of Partial because it only supports a subset of
      the sub-techniques (3 of 4) and because the source of the attack would have
      to be known before rules could be put in place to protect against it.

    score-comment: Google Cloud Firewalls can allow or deny traffic based on the traffic's
      protocol, destination ports, sources, and destinations. This functionality can
      be used to block adversaries from accessing resources such as cloud storage
      objects by implementing restrictions on which IP addresses and domains can access
      the resources (e.g., allow lists). However, since cloud storage objects are
      located outside the virtual private cloud where Google Cloud Firewalls protect,
      the mapping is only given a score of Partial.
