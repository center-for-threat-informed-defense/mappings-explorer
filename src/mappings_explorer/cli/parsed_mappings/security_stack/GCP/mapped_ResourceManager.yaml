    score-comment: Resource Manager can easily modify your Cloud Identity and Access
      Management policies for your organization and folders, and the changes will
      apply across all the projects and resources. Create and manage IAM access control
      policies for your organization and projects. This control may prevent adversaries
      that try to discover resources by placing a limit on discovery of these resources
      with least privilege.

    score-comment: Google Cloud Platform provides resource containers such as organizations,
      folders, and projects that allow one to group and hierarchically organize other
      GCP resources. This control may mitigate by denying direct remote access to

      from adversaries that may attempt to discover containers and other resources
      that are available within a containers environment.

    score-comment: To control access to resources, GCP requires that accounts making
      API requests have appropriate IAM roles. IAM roles include permissions that
      allow users to perform specific actions on Google Cloud resources. This control
      may mitigate adversaries that gather credentials via APIs within a containers
      environment. Since this covers only one of the sub-techniques, it is given a
