    score-comment: 'This control can provide protection against attackers stealing
      application access tokens if they are stored within Secret Manager. Secret Manager
      significantly raises the bar for access of stored tokens by requiring legitimate
      credentials with proper authorization. Applications may have to be modified
      to take advantage of Secret Manager and may not always be possible to utilize. '

    score-comment: This control provides secure methods for accessing secrets and
      passwords. This can reduce the incidents of credentials and other authentication
      material being transmitted in clear-text or by insecure encryption methods.
      Any communication between applications or endpoints after access to Secret Manager
      may not be secure.
