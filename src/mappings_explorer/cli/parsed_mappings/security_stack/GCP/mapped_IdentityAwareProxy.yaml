    score-comment: Adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud
      account to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and instances within
      the environment. IAP lets you enforce access control policies for applications
      and resources. This control may help mitigate against adversaries gaining access
      through cloud account by the configuration of access controls and firewalls,
      allowing limited access to systems.

    score-comment: IAP applies the relevant IAM policy to check if the user is authorized
      to access the requested resource. If the user has the IAP-secured Web App User
      role on the Cloud console project where the resource exists, they're authorized
      to access the application. This control can mitigate against adversaries that
      try to obtain credentials of accounts, including cloud accounts.
