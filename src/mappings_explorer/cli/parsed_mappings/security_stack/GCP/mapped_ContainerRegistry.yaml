    score-comment: Using Container Analysis, Container Registry scans the repository
      for vulnerabilities that could potentially be used to escalate privileges, such
      as default accounts with root permissions in Docker containers. Due to the medium
      threat protection coverage and scan results being available 48 hours after completion,
      this control was scored as partial.
