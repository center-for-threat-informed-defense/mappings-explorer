    score-comment: Main memory encryption is performed using dedicated hardware within
      the memory controllers. Each controller includes a high-performance Advanced
      Encryption Standard (AES) engine. The AES engine encrypts data as it is written
      to DRAM or shared between sockets, and decrypts it when data is read.
