    score-comment: 'ReCAPTCHA Enterprise allows users to configure Multifactor Authentication
      (MFA) to verify user''s identity by sending a verification code by email or
      SMS (known as an MFA challenge). When ReCAPTCHA Enterprise assesses that user
      activity to exceeds a predetermined threshold (by the developer), it can trigger
      an MFA challenge to verify the user. This increases the likelihood that a compromised
      account will be prevented from impacting the system.


      Since ReCAPTCHA Enterprise does not require a MFA challenge for all user activity,
      it has been given a rating of Partial.

    score-comment: 'Password Checkup extension for Chrome displays a warning whenever
      a user signs in to a site using one of over 4 billion usernames and passwords
      that Google knows to be unsafe due to a third-party data breach. With reCAPTCHA
      Enterprise, you can identify credential stuffing attacks by utilizing Password
      Checkup to detect password leaks and breached credentials. Developers can factor
      this information into their score calculation for score-based site keys to help
      identify suspicious activity and take appropriate action.

    score-comment: 'ReCAPTCHA Enterprise can implement a number of mitigations to
      prevent the automated creation of multiple accounts such as adding checkbox
      challenges on pages where end users need to enter their credentials and assessing
      user activity for potential misuses on all pages where accounts are created.


      Since this control doesn''t prevent the manual creation of accounts, it has
      been given a rating of Partial.
