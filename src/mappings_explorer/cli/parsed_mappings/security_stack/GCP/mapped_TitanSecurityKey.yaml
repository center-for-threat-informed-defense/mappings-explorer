    score-comment: This control is able to mitigate against a variety of phishing
      attacks by requiring an additional key for authentication outside of the user's
      password. Compared to other forms of 2-factor authentication, this control will
      not allow for authentication to an illegitimate service or website as the key
      can not be transmitted from the hardware device to any other device.
