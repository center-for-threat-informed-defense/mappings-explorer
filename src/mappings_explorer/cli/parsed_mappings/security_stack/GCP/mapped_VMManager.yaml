    score-comment: VM Manager can apply on-demand and scheduled patches via automated
      patch deployment. This can remediate OS and software vulnerabilities that could
      otherwise be exploited. Since VM Manager doesn't directly prevent exploitation
      of active vulnerabilities (including zero day vulnerabilities) this control
      has resulted in a score of Partial.
