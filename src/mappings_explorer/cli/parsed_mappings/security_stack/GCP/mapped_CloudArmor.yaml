    score-comment: Traffic to known anonymity networks and C2 infrastructure can be
      blocked through the use of network allow and block lists. However this can be
      circumvented by other techniques.

    score-comment: Google Cloud Armor security policies protect your application by
      providing Layer 7 filtering and by scrubbing incoming requests for common web
      attacks or other Layer 7 attributes. Google Cloud Armor detects malicious requests
      and drops them at the edge of Google's infrastructure.

    score-comment: Google Cloud Armor provides always-on DDoS protection against network
      or protocol-based volumetric DDoS attacks. It allows users to allow/deny traffic
      at the Google Cloud edge, closest to the source of traffic. This prevents unwelcome
      traffic from consuming resources.
