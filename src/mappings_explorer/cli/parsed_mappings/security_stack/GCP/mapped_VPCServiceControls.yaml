    score-comment: This control is able to mitigate against abuse of compromised valid
      accounts by restricting access from those accounts to resources contained within
      the VPC perimeter the account belongs to. Resources and services contained in
      other VPC networks also cannot be accessed by user accounts that are not within
      the VPC network perimeter.

    score-comment: This control is able to mitigate against exfiltration of data over
      a web service. Data contained within a VPC network perimeter can not be moved
      to a Google cloud resource or service outside of the perimeter but may be moved
