    score-comment: This control can help mitigate adversaries that may try to steal
      data over network protocols.  Data loss prevention can detect and block sensitive
      data being uploaded via web browsers. In Beyond Corp Enterprise, Data Loss Prevention
      (DLP) features to use with Chrome to implement sensitive data detection for
      files that are uploaded and downloaded, and for content that is pasted or dragged
      and dropped. An example includes a rule setting that is used to block files
      from being uploaded via Chrome browser.

      one can access your resources unless they meet all the rules and conditions.
      Instead of securing your resources at the network-level, access controls are
      instead applied to individual devices and users.

    score-comment: Google chrome policies can be setup through the Google Admin console,
      which can ensure checks for sensitive data or help protect Chrome users from
      content that may contain malware. This also enables certain files to be sent
      for analysis, and in return the admin can then choose to allow or block uploads
      and downloads for those scanned and unscanned files. By specifying a list of
      URL patterns, these policies can determine which pages identified through Chrome
      violates a rule, and end users are prevented from accessing the page.

      Access levels applied on resources with IAM Conditions enforce fine-grained
      access control based on a variety of attributes, including IP subnetworks. Adversaries
      may obtain leaked credentials; however, this control can block specific  adversaries
