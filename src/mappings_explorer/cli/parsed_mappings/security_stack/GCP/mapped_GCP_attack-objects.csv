SCC also provides users with compliance mappings that scan environments against violations according to PCI-DSS v3.2.1, OWASP Top Ten, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001. 

To improve cyber-situational awareness and detection against various threats, SCC ingests logging data from multiple sources. Cloud Audit Admin Activity logs are always enabled by default and cannot be disabled. SCC Premium consumes logs automatically when activated. SSH Logs and syslog inform the brute force detector, and the set of network logs (VPC Flow/Cloud Firewall/Cloud NAT/Cloud DNS).

Further automated response functionality can be extended in SCC to take actions against threats. A full list of automated actions can be found on GCP's GitHub.
