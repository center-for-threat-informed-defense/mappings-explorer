Due to the fact that a user's password is not checked  against the banned list of passwords unless the user changes or resets their  password (which is an infrequent event), there is still ample opportunity  for attackers to utilize this technique to gain access. This is what prevented the score from being elevated to Significant.\n", "references": ["https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad"], "score-category": "Protect", "score-value": "Partial", "score-comment": null, "related-score": true, "tags": ["Azure Active Directory", "Credentials", "Identity", "Passwords"]}}]
