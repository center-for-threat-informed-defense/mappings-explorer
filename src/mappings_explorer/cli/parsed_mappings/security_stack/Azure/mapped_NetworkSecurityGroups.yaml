    score-comment: This control can restrict ports and inter-system / inter-enclave
      connections as described by the Proxy related sub-techniques although it doesn't
      provide protection for domain-fronting.  It furthermore provides partial protection
      of this technique's procedure examples resulting in an overall Partial score.
