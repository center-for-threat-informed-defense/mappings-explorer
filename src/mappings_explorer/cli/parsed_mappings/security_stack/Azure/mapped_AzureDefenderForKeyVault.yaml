    score-comment: This control may alert on suspicious access of key vaults, including
      suspicious listing of key vault contents. This control does not alert on discovery
      of other cloud services, such as VMs, snapshots, cloud storage and therefore
      has minimal coverage. Suspicious activity based on patterns of access from certain
      users and applications allows for managing false positive rates.

    score-comment: 'This control may detect suspicious secret access from Azure key
      vaults. This does not apply to any sub-techniques under T1555 - Credentials
      from Password Stores but Azure Key Vault can be treated as a store for passwords,
      keys, and certificates. The coverage of this control could be deemed high for
      cloud credential and secret storage within Key Vault but is not applicable to
      traditional password stores, such as password managers, keychain, or web browsers. '
