    score-category: Respond
    score-comment: This control provides a response capability that accompanies its
      detection capability that can contain and eradicate the impact of this technique.  Because
      this capability varies between containment (federated accounts) and eradication
      (cloud accounts) and is only able to respond to some of this technique's sub-techniques,
      it has been scored as Partial.

    score-category: Detect
    score-comment: This control can be effective at detecting forged web credentials
      because it uses environmental properties (e.g. IP address, device info, etc.)
      to detect risky users and sign-ins even when valid credentials are utilized.  It
      provides partial coverage of this technique's sub-techniques and therefore has
      been assessed a Partial score.
