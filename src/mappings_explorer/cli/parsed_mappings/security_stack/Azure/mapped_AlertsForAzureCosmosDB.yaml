    score-comment: This control's detection is specific to the Cosmos DB and therefore
      provides minimal overall detection coverage for Valid Accounts resulting in
      a Minimal score. A relevant alert is "Access from an unusual location to a Cosmos
      DB account".

    score-category: Detect
    score-comment: This control triggers an alert when an unusually large amount of
      data is extracted from/by an account compared to recent activity. False positives
      are fairly likely and extraction in quantities below the control's threshold
      is not detected, so score is Minimal. Neither of the sub-techniques are relevant
      in this context, since they are repository-specific.  Relevant alert is "Unusual
      amount of data extracted from a Cosmos DB account"
