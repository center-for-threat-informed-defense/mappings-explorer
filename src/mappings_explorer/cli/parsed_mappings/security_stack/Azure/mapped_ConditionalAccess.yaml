      significant protection against  password compromises, requiring an adversary
      to complete an additional authentication method before their access is permitted.

    score-comment: Conditional Access, when granting (risky) users access to cloud
      storage, specifically OneDrive, can restrict what they can do in these applications
      using its app-enforced restrictions.   For example, it can enforce that users
      on unmanaged devices will have browser-only access to OneDrive with no ability
      to download, print, or sync files.  This can impede an adversary's ability to
      exfiltrate data from OneDrive.  The protection coverage provided by this control
      is Minimal as it doesn't provide protection for other storage services available
      on Azure such as the Azure Storage service.
