    score-comment: This control can be configured to completely block inbound access
      to selected ports until access is requested. This prevents any attempt at exploitation
      of a public-facing application unless the attacker has the credentials and permissions
      to request such access. Even if permission has been granted to an authorized
      user to access the virtual machine, a list of authorized IP addresses for that
      access can be configured. The score is minimal, since this control only applies
      to specific applications requiring credentialed access, as opposed to a public
      webserver
