    comments: RBAC enables organizations to limit the number of users within the organization
      with an IAM role that has administrative privileges.  This enables limiting
      the number of users within the tenant that have privileged access thereby resulting
      in a reduced attack surface and a coverage score factor of Partial.  Most sub-techniques
      have been scored as Partial for this reason.
