      many of the detections provided by this control do not provide a detailed description
      of the detection logic making it often times difficult to map to ATT&CK Techniques.

    score-comment: "This controls's \"Suspicious additions to sensitive groups (external\
      \ ID 2024)\" alert can utilize machine learning to detect when an attacker adds\
      \ users to highly privileged groups. Adding users is done to gain access to\
      \ more resources, and gain persistency.  This detection relies on profiling\
      \ the group modification activities of users, and alerting when an abnormal\
      \ addition to a sensitive group is observed. Defender for Identity profiles\
      \ continuously. \nThis alert provides Partial coverage of this technique with\
      \ a reduced false-positive rate by utilizing machine learning models."
