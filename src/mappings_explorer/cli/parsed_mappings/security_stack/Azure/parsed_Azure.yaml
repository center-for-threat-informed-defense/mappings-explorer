    comments: RBAC enables organizations to limit the number of users within the organization

      the number of users within the tenant that have privileged access thereby resulting
      in a reduced attack surface and a coverage score factor of Partial.  Most sub-techniques
      have been scored as Partial for this reason.

      The alerts can pick up outbound Denial of Service (DOS) attacks, though that''s
      not an ATT&CK technique  per se (description oriented towards inbound DOS),

      is oriented towards cryptomining).'

      Access tactic, but does not clearly detect any specific technique or set of
      techniques, so it has been omitted from this mapping.

    comments: 'All scores have been assessed as Partial because this control increases
      the strength of user passwords thereby reducing the likelihood of a successful
      brute force attack.  Due to the fact that a user''s password is not checked  against
      the banned list of passwords unless the user changes or resets their  password
      (which is an infrequent event), there is still ample opportunity  for attackers
      to utilize this technique to gain access. This is what prevented the score from
      being elevated to Significant.
