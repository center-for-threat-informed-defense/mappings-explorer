    comments: 'All scores have been assessed as Partial because this control increases
      the strength of user passwords thereby reducing the likelihood of a successful
      brute force attack.  Due to the fact that a user''s password is not checked  against
      the banned list of passwords unless the user changes or resets their  password
      (which is an infrequent event), there is still ample opportunity  for attackers
      to utilize this technique to gain access. This is what prevented the score from
      being elevated to Significant.
