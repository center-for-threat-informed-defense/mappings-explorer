  AWS CloudEndure Disaster Recovery enables the replication and recovery of physical, virtual, and
  cloud-based servers into AWS Cloud including public regions, AWS GovCloud, and AWS Outposts. AWS
  CloudEndure continuously replicates servers and can launch fully provisioned machines within
  minutes in the event that a disaster such as data center failures, server corruption, or cyber
  attacks occur.

          AWS CloudEndure Disaster Recovery enables the replication and recovery of servers into AWS
          Cloud. In the event that a public-facing application or server is compromised, AWS
          CloudEndure can be used to provision an instance of the server from a previous point in
          time within minutes. As a result, this mapping is given a score of Significant.

          AWS CloudEndure Disaster Recovery enables the replication and recovery of servers into AWS
          Cloud. In the event that data on servers is destroyed, AWS CloudEndure can be used to
          provision an instance of the server from a previous point in time within minutes. As a
          result, this mapping is given a score of Significant.

          AWS CloudEndure Disaster Recovery enables the replication and recovery of servers into AWS
          Cloud. In the event that data on servers is encrypted (e.g., ransomware), AWS CloudEndure can be used to
          provision an instance of the server from a previous point in time within minutes. As a
          result, this mapping is given a score of Significant.

          AWS CloudEndure Disaster Recovery enables the replication and recovery of servers into AWS
          Cloud. In the event that data on servers is manipulated, AWS CloudEndure can be used to
          provision an instance of the server from a previous point in time within minutes. This
          mapping is given a score of Minimal because it only supports a subset (1 of 3) of the
          sub-techniques.
