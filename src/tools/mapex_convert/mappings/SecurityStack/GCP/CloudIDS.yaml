description: >-
  Cloud IDS is an intrusion detection service that inspects network traffic and triggers alerts to
  intrusions, malware, spyware, or other cyber-attacks. Cloud IDS' default ruleset is powered by
  Palo Alto Network's advanced threat detection technologies and the vendor's  latest set of threat
  signatures (e.g., antivirus, anti-spyware, or vulnerability signatures). Cloud IDS is
  dependent on Cloud logging feature to collect network telemetry. Further threat detection rule can
  be crafted to generate alerts based on network traffic (e.g., PCAP, Netflow).

  This mapping was scored as significant due to the control’s notable detection accuracy, mappable
  threat coverage, and time-related factors (e.g., real-time).

  The cyber-attacks mapped are considered a subset of the most notable threat detection available
  for Cloud IDS, but a thorough mapping to all of Palo Alto Network's advanced threat detection
  technologies wasn't possible due to constant updates, 3rd party vendor's extensive documentation,
  and new threat signatures.
