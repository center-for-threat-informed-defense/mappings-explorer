  Web Risk is a Google Cloud service that lets client applications check URLs against Google's
  constantly updated lists of unsafe web resources. Unsafe web resources include social engineering
  sites—such as phishing and deceptive sites—and sites that host malware or unwanted software. With
  the Web Risk, you can quickly identify known bad sites, warn users before they click infected
  links, and prevent users from posting links to known infected pages from your site.

          Web Risk allows client applications to check URLs against Google's list of unsafe web
          resources. It also can provide warnings when attempting to access potentially unsafe
          sites. However, Google cannot guarantee that its information is comprehensive and
          error-free: some risky sites may not be identified, and some safe sites may be classified
          in error. This has resulted in an overall score of Partial.
