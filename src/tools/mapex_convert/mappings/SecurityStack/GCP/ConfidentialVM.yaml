          Main memory encryption is performed using dedicated hardware within the memory
          controllers. Each controller includes a high-performance Advanced Encryption Standard
          (AES) engine. The AES engine encrypts data as it is written to DRAM or shared between
          sockets, and decrypts it when data is read.
