description: Defender for Identity Lateral Movement Paths (LMPs) are visual
  guides that help you quickly understand and identify exactly how attackers can
  move laterally inside your network, with easy to interpret, direct visual
  guidance on your most vulnerable, sensitive accounts. LMPs help you mitigate
  and prevent those risks, and close attacker access.
