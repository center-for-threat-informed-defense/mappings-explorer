name: Passwordless Authentication
description: Features like multi-factor authentication (MFA) are a great way to
  secure your organization, but users often get frustrated with the additional
  security layer on top of having to remember their passwords. Passwordless
  authentication methods are more convenient because the password is removed and
  replaced with something you have, plus something you are or something you
  know.
