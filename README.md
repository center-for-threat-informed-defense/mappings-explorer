# Mappings Explorer

Mappings Explorer enables cyber defenders to understand how security controls
and capabilities map onto the adversary behaviors catalogued in the MITRE ATT&CK®
knowledge base. The[Center for Threat-Informed Defense}(https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/) created these open source
mappings to serve as a bridge between the threat-informed approach to cybersecurity
and the traditional perspective applied to the employment of security controls.

## Overview

The website provides an open, curated knowledge base of Center mapping projects between
the ATT&CK framework and security capabilities/controls. The mappings have been brought
into a structured data format, allowing for this expanded accessibility and usability
including search capabilities. A customizable ATT&CK Navigator of the control framework
mappings is provided for visual exploration of the mappings and viewing mapping coverage.
Usage documentation is also hosted on Mappings Explorer, including mapping methodologies
to determine the capabilities of a platform's security offerings and use cases to
demonstrate how the mappings can be used. In addition, the mapping resources are linked
via the website, making them easy to download.

# Mappings Explorer

You can use Mappings Explorer for many different purposes. Examples of usage include:

Align cyber defense to adversary behavior.

- Explore how your current or promposedproposed security controls can be used to detect,
  prevent, mitigate, or respond to specific adversary behaviors seen in the wild.

Expand the Vocabulary for Incident Response.

- The VERIS mappings connect the incident response terminology of the Verizon DBIR to
  the adversary behavior in MITRE ATT&CK for a more complete analysis of any breach.

Assess Unpatched Vulnerabilities.

- The CVE mappings help understand how adversaries might exploit unpatched vulnerabilities
  and what the knock-on effects could be.

Evolve and Expand Cyber Defense.

- Visualize and assess deficiencies in cyber defense. Plan future policy and security
  controls around real-world adversary behavior.

# Mappings Editor

The Mappings Editor is a custom-built tool developed under the Mappings Explorer project.
This lightweight, easy to use tool is being used internally by the Center to create new
and update existing capability mappings to ATT&CK objects.
