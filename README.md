# Mappings Explorer

Mappings Explorer enables cyber defenders to understand how security controls
and capabilities map onto the adversary behaviors catalogued in the [MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/)
knowledge base. The [Center for Threat-Informed Defense](https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/) created these open source
mappings to serve as a bridge between the threat-informed approach to cybersecurity
and the traditional perspective applied to the employment of security controls.

## Overview

The website provides an open, curated knowledge base of Center mapping projects between
the ATT&CK framework and security capabilities/controls. The mappings have been brought
into a structured data format, allowing for this expanded accessibility and usability
including search capabilities. A customizable ATT&CK Navigator of the control framework
mappings is provided for visual exploration of the mappings and viewing mapping coverage.
Usage documentation is also hosted on Mappings Explorer, including mapping methodologies
to determine the capabilities of a platform's security offerings and use cases to
demonstrate how the mappings can be used. In addition, the mapping resources are linked
via the website, making them easy to download.

### Mappings Explorer Usage

You can use Mappings Explorer for many different purposes. Examples of usage include:

**Align Cyber Defense to Threats​** 

- Explore how security controls and capabilities can be used to protect from, detect, or
  respond to specific adversary behaviors.​

**Assess Unpatched Vulnerabilities​**

- Understand how adversaries might exploit unpatched vulnerabilities and what adversaries
  may achieve by exploiting the vulnerability.​

**Evolve and Expand Cyber Defense​**

- Visualize and assess deficiencies in cyber defense to plan future policy and security
  controls around real-world adversary behavior.​

**Effectively Describe Incidents​**

- Create detailed incident reports incorporating ATT&CK-based threat intel, recommendations
  for increased security protocols, and response measures.​

### Mappings Editor

The Mappings Editor is a custom-built tool developed under the Mappings Explorer project. The 
Mappings Editor enables the mapping of customized security controls or capabilities to ATT&CK, 
either to be used solely internally within an organization or shared with the Center or other 
organizations. This lightweight, easy to use tool is being used internally by the Center to 
create new and update existing capability mappings to ATT&CK objects. Contact the Center at 
[ctid@mitre-engenuity.org](mailto:ctid@mitre-engenuity.org?subject=subject=Question%20about%20mappings-explorer) to learn more about using Mappings Editor.

#### Mappings Editor Usage

Mappings Editor usage includes:

**Create Customized Mappings**

- Create customized mappings for products or systems in use at your organization. Use those
  mappings to view and better understand current coverage of adversary behaviors provided by
  the mapped tools and capabilities.

**Integrate Mappings**

- Create customized mappings for product capability or system settings. Use those mappings to
  integrate threat-informed defense into security operations, such as new system and network
  set up and configuration or to provide remediation actions to take in incident reports.

**Share Mappings Contributions**

- Create and share security capability mappings with the Center or other organizations using a
  unified data schema.

## Getting Started

To get started understanding how security controls and capabilities map onto the adversary behaviors 
catalogued in ATT&CK, visit the Mappings Explorer website. 

Visit the Mappings Editor GitHub page to learn more about that tool.
