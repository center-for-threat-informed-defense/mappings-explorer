# Mappings Explorer

Mappings Explorer enables cyber defenders to understand how security controls
and capabilities map onto the adversary behaviors catalogued in the [MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/)
knowledge base. The [Center for Threat-Informed Defense](https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/) created these open source
mappings to serve as a bridge between the threat-informed approach to cybersecurity
and the traditional perspective applied to the employment of security controls.

| [Mappings Explorer](https://center-for-threat-informed-defense.github.io/mappings-explorer/) | A website to access, explore, search, and download our ATT&CK mappings.                                   |
| [Mappings Editor](https://center-for-threat-informed-defense.github.io/mappings-editor)      | An interactive, web-based tool for creating your own mappings. (This tool is available as a public beta.) |

## Getting Involved

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help
advance threat-informed defense.

- **Visit the Mappings Explorer website.** Use the website to browse, navigate, search,
  and download mappings data.
- **Recommend new mappings projects.** Is there a security control framework (or other
  security capability) that is not in Mappings Explorer but should be? [Let us
  know.](mailto:ctid@mitre-engenuity.org?subject=Mappings%20Explorer%20framework%20request)
- **Create new mappings.** The Mappings Editor is released as a public beta; you may try
  using it to create your own mappings data. The mappings data can be used internally
  inside your organization, or if you think the public would benefit, we would be happy
  to accept pull requests for new mappings. Please [get in touch with
  us]((mailto:ctid@mitre-engenuity.org?subject=Mappings%20Explorer%20framework%20submission))
  ahead of time so that we can coordinate submissions.

## Use Cases

You can use Mappings Explorer for many different purposes. Examples of usage include:

- **Align cyber defense to threats**. Explore how security controls and capabilities can be used to protect from, detect, or
    respond to specific adversary behaviors.​

- **Assess unpatched vulnerabilities​**. Understand how adversaries might exploit unpatched vulnerabilities and what adversaries
  may achieve by exploiting the vulnerability.​

- **Evolve and expand cyber defense​**: Visualize and assess deficiencies in cyber defense to plan future policy and security
  controls around real-world adversary behavior.​

- **Effectively describe incidents​**. Create detailed incident reports incorporating ATT&CK-based threat intel, recommendations
  for increased security protocols, and response measures.​

## Mappings Editor

The Mappings Editor is a custom-built tool developed under the Mappings Explorer
project. This lightweight, easy to use tool is being used internally by the Center to
create new and update existing capability mappings to ATT&CK objects. It is available
for your own use as a public beta, but most users should not need to use this tool.
Instead, you should generally use the mappings data available on the Mappings Explorer
website.
