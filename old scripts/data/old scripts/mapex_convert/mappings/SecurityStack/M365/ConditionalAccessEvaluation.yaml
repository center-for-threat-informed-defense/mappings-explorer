name: Conditional Access Evaluation
description: Continuous access evaluation proactively terminates active user
  sessions and enforces tenant policy changes in near real time instead of
  relying on access token expiration. Microsoft Entra ID notifies continuous
  access evaluation-enabled Microsoft 365 services (such as SharePoint, Teams,
  and Exchange) when the user account or tenant has changed in a way that
  requires reevaluation of the user account's authentication state.
