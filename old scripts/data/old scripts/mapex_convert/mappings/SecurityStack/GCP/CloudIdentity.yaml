description: >-
  Cloud Identity is an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) and enterprise mobility management (EMM)
  product. It offers the identity services and endpoint administration that are available in Google
  Workspace as a stand-alone product. As an end-user, Cloud Identity protects user access with
  multi-factor authentication. As an administrator, one can use Cloud Identity to manage users,
  apps, and devices from a central locationâ€”the Google Admin console.

          This control may mitigate brute force attacks by enforcing multi-factor authentication,
          enforcing strong password policies, and rotating credentials periodically. These
          recommendations are IAM best practices but must be explicitly implemented by a cloud
          administrator.

          MFA and enforcing the principal of least privilege can be used to control adversaries and
          possibly hinder them from gaining access to a victim network or a private code repository.
