  VM Manager is a suite of tools that can be used to manage operating systems for large virtual
  machine (VM) fleets running Windows and Linux on Compute Engine.


  VM Manager helps drive efficiency through automation and reduces the operational burden of
  maintaining these VM fleets.

          VM Manager can apply on-demand and scheduled patches via automated patch deployment. This
          can remediate OS and software vulnerabilities that could otherwise be exploited. Since VM
          Manager doesn't directly prevent exploitation of active vulnerabilities (including zero
          day vulnerabilities) this control has resulted in a score of Partial.

  This mapping was scored as Partial due to the medium threat protection coverage to specific (sub-)
  techniques of MITREâ€™s ATT&CK framework.
