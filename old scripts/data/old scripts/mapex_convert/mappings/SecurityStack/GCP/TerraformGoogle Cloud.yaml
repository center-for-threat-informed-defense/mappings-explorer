description: >-
  Terraform is an open source tool that lets you provision Google Cloud resources with declarative
  configuration files—resources such as virtual machines, containers, storage, and networking.
  Terraform's infrastructure-as-code (IaC) approach supports DevOps best practices for change
  management, letting you manage Terraform configuration files in source control to maintain an
  ideal provisioning state for testing and production environments.

comments: >-
  In its current state, this control was scored as not mappable as it does not look reasonable to
  correlate to specific (sub-) techniques of MITRE’s ATT&CK.


  While Terraform provides some security capabilities specific to Terraform processes (encryption
  between Terraform Clients, encrypting workspace variables, 

  Isolation between Terraform executions and Cloud tenants) the capabilities don't necessarily
  benefit the entire organization. Terraform's primary function is to support the provisioning of
  Google resources with configuration management. Therefore, this control has been identified as
  not-mappable.
