          Chronicle is able to trigger an alerts based off suspicious system processes, such as
          binaries in use on Windows machines. For example: PsExec is a free Microsoft tool that can
          be used to escalate privileges from administrator to SYSTEM with the -s argument, download
          files over a network share, and remotely create accounts.

  This mapping is given a score of minimal due to low threat detection fidelity from specific
  (sub-)techniques found in MITRE’s ATT&CK framework. 


  Chronicle is able to ingest and aggregate raw logs from multiple data formats, to include: json,
  csv, xml, and syslog.
