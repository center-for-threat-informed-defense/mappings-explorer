  The AWS Network Firewall provides a stateful network firewall and intrusion detection and
  prevention system (via Suricata) at the perimeter of virtual private clouds (VPCs). It is able to
  filter traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, VPN, or AWS  Direct
  Connect.

          AWS Network Firewall has the ability to pass, drop, or alert on traffic based on the
          network protocol as well as perform deep packet inspection on the payload. This
          functionality can be used to block malicious or unwanted traffic leveraging application
          layer protocols. Given this supports all sub-techniques, the mapping is given a score of
          Significant.

          AWS Network Firewall has the ability to pass, drop, or alert on traffic based on the
          network protocol as well as perform deep packet inspection on the payload. This
          functionality can be used to block adversaries from accessing resources such as cloud
          storage objects by implementing restrictions on which IP addresses and domains can access
          the resources (e.g., allow lists). However, since cloud storage objects are located
          outside the virtual private cloud where the AWS Network Firewall protects, the mapping is
          only given a score of Partial.

          network protocol as well as perform deep packet inspection on the payload. This

          Network Firewall could block the source of the denial of service attack. This mapping is
          given a score of Partial because it only supports a subset of the sub-techniques (3 of 4)
          and because the source of the attack would have to be known before rules could be put in

          AWS Network Firewall has the ability to pass, drop, or alert on traffic based on the
          network protocol as well as perform deep packet inspection on the payload. This
          functionality can be used to only allow certain remote services to be available.
          Futhermore, it can enforce restrictions such that remote services are only from trusted
          hosts (i.e., only allow remote access traffic from certain hosts). This mapping is given a
          score of Partial because while it can limit which external remote services and hosts can
          be used to access the network, it cannot protect against the misuse of legitimate external
          remote services (e.g., it cannot protect against an adversary using a trusted host that is
          permitted to use remote services as part of an attack).

          functionality can be used to restrict access to the endpoints within the virtual private
          cloud and protect against adversaries gathering information about the network. While this
          mapping supports most of the sub-techniques (4 of 6), it is only given a score of Partial
          because it only protects against attempts to gather information via scanning that
          originate from outside the firewall and it does not protect against phishing.
