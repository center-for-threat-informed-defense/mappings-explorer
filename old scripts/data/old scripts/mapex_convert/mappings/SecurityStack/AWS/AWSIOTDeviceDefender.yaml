  AWS IoT Device Defender is a security service that allows users to audit the configuration of
  their Internet of Things (IoT) devices, monitor connected devices to detect abnormal behavior,
  and mitigate security risks. It provides the ability to enforce consistent security policies
  across AWS IoT device fleets and respond when devices are compromised.

              The following AWS IoT Device Defender audit checks and corresponding mitigation
              actions can identify and resolve configuration problems that should be fixed in order

              The following AWS IoT Device Defender audit checks can identify potentially malicious
              use of valid cloud credentials by AWS IoT devices, which may indicate that devices

              "CA certificate revoked but device certificates still active"
              ("REVOKED_CA_CERTIFICATE_STILL_ACTIVE_CHECK" in the CLI and API) indicates that
              device certificates signed using a revoked CA certificate are still active, which may
              indicate that devices using those certificates are controlled by an adversary if the
              CA certificate was revoked due to compromise. "Device certificate shared"
              ("DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_SHARED_CHECK" in the CLI and API), "Revoked device certificate
              still active" ("REVOKED_DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_STILL_ACTIVE_CHECK" in the CLI and API),
              and "Conflicting MQTT client IDs" ("CONFLICTING_CLIENT_IDS_CHECK" in the CLI and API)
              can indicate that devices are in use with duplicate certificates and/or IDs and/or
              certificates that have been revoked due to compromise, all of which suggest that an
              adversary may be using clones of compromised devices to leverage their access.

              The following AWS IoT Device Defender cloud-side detection metrics can identify
              potentially malicious use of valid cloud credentials by IoT devices, which may

              "Source IP" ("aws:source-ip-address") values outside of expected IP address ranges may
              suggest that a device has been stolen. "Authorization failures"
              ("aws:num-authorization-failures") counts above a typical threshold may indicate that
              a compromised device is attempting to use its connection to AWS IoT to access
              resources for which it does not have access and being denied. High counts for
              "Disconnects" ("aws:num-disconnects"), especially in conjunction with high counts for
              "Connection attempts" ("aws:num-connection-attempts"), which include successful

              The following AWS IoT Device Defender audit checks and corresponding mitigation
              actions can identify and in some cases resolve configuration problems that should be
              fixed in order to limit the potential impact of compromised accounts with access to
              AWS IoT resources:
              The "Authenticated Cognito role overly permissive"

              actions to Amazon Cognito identity pool roles. The "Unauthenticated Cognito role
              overly permissive" ("UNAUTHENTICATED_COGNITO_ROLE_OVERLY_PERMISSIVE_CHECK" in the CLI
              and API) audit check can identify policies which grant excessive privileges and
              permissions for AWS IoT actions to Amazon Cognito identity pool roles and do not
              require authentication, which pose a substantial risk because they can be trivially
              accessed. The "AWS IoT policies overly permissive"
              ("IOT_POLICY_OVERLY_PERMISSIVE_CHECK" in the CLI and API) audit check can identify AWS
              IoT policies which grant excessive privileges and permissions for AWS IoT actions and
              supports the "REPLACE_DEFAULT_POLICY_VERSION" mitigation action which can reduce
              permissions to limit potential misuse. The "Role alias allows access to unused
              services" ("IOT_ROLE_ALIAS_ALLOWS_ACCESS_TO_UNUSED_SERVICES_CHECK" in the CLI and API)
              and "Role alias overly permissive" ("IOT_ROLE_ALIAS_OVERLY_PERMISSIVE_CHECK" in the
              CLI and API) audit checks can identify AWS IoT role aliases which allow connected
              devices to authenticate using their certificates and obtain short-lived AWS
              credentials from an associated IAM role which grant permissions and privileges beyond
              those necessary to the devices' functions and should be fixed in order to prevent
              further account compromise from compromised devices.

              Coverage factor is partial for these checks and mitigations, since they are specific

          sending and/or receiving non-standard traffic, which may include data retrieved from cloud
          storage.

          The following AWS IoT Device Defender device-side detection metrics can detect indicators
          that an adversary may be leveraging compromised AWS IoT devices and the Message Queuing
          Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol for unauthorized data transfer from cloud-side data
          sources: "Bytes in" ("aws:all-bytes-in"), "Bytes out" ("aws:all-bytes-out"), "Packets in"
          ("aws:all-packets-in"), and "Packets out" ("aws:all-packets-out") values outside of
          expected norms may indicate that devices are sending and/or receiving non-standard
          traffic, which may include data retrieved from cloud storage.

          Coverage factor is partial, since these metrics are limited to IoT device-based
          collection, resulting in an overall score of Partial.

              The following AWS IoT Device Defender audit checks can identify potentially malicious
              use of private keys associated with AWS IoT devices, which may indicate that the keys
              have been taken from compromised devices and repurposed by an adversary:
              "Device certificate shared" ("DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_SHARED_CHECK" in the CLI and API) and
              "Revoked device certificate still active"
              ("REVOKED_DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_STILL_ACTIVE_CHECK" in the CLI and API) can indicate that
              devices are in use with duplicate certificates and/or certificates that have been
              revoked due to compromise, both of which suggest that an adversary may be misusing
              stolen private keys.

              Coverage factor is partial for these checks and mitigations, since they are specific
              to use of private keys associated with AWS IoT devices, resulting in an overall score
              of Partial.

          The following AWS IoT Device Defender audit checks and corresponding mitigation actions
          can identify and resolve configuration problems that should be fixed in order to ensure
          SSL/TLS encryption is enabled and secure to protect network traffic to/from IoT devices:
          "CA certificate expiring" ("CA_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRING_CHECK" in the CLI and API), "CA
          certificate key quality" ("CA_CERTIFICATE_KEY_QUALITY_CHECK" in the CLI and API), and "CA
          certificate revoked but device certificates still active"
          ("REVOKED_CA_CERTIFICATE_STILL_ACTIVE_CHECK" in the CLI and API) can identify problems
          with certificate authority (CA) certificates being used for signing and support the
          "UPDATE_CA_CERTIFICATE" mitigation action which can resolve them. "Device certificate
          expiring" ("DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRING_CHECK" in the CLI and API), "Device certificate
          key quality" ("DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_KEY_QUALITY_CHECK" in the CLI and API), "Device
          certificate shared" ("DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_SHARED_CHECK" in the CLI and API), and "Revoked
          device certificate still active" ("REVOKED_DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_STILL_ACTIVE_CHECK" in the
          CLI and API) can identify problems with IoT devices' certificates and support the
          "UPDATE_DEVICE_CERTIFICATE" and "ADD_THINGS_TO_THING_GROUP" mitigation actions which can
          resolve them.

          Coverage factor is partial for these checks and mitigations, since they are specific to
          IoT device communication and can only mitigate behavior for adversaries who are unable to
          decrypt the relevant traffic, resulting in an overall score of Partial. This control does
          not provide specific coverage for this technique's sub-techniques, resulting in an overall

              The "Logging disabled" audit check ("LOGGING_DISABLED_CHECK" in the CLI and API) can
              identify potentially malicious changes to AWS IoT logs (both V1 and V2), which should
              be enabled in Amazon CloudWatch. Score is limited to Partial since this control only

              The "ENABLE_IOT_LOGGING" mitigation action (which is supported by the "Logging
              disabled" audit check) enables AWS IoT logging if it is not enabled when the check is
              run, effectively reversing the adversary behavior if those logs were disabled due to
              malicious changes. Score is limited to Partial since this control only addresses IoT
              logging.

  Mappings for AWS IoT Device Defender audit are based on the current set of AWS IoT Device Defender
  audit checks that can be enabled. AWS IoT Device Defender's predefined mitigation actions are also
  included for those audit checks that support them. Audit checks can be run as needed
  (on-demand audits) or scheduled to be run periodically (scheduled audits), so temporal scoring
  factors are uniformly high for this control, based on the assumption that checks are run (at
  minimum) on a frequent basis. Audit check and mitigation names are identified in quotes throughout
  this mapping.

  Mappings for AWS IoT Device Defender detect are based on the current set of AWS IoT Device
  Defender device-side and cloud-side detection metrics. Cloud-side detection alarms are triggered
  when set thresholds are exceeded, and device-side detection metrics are published on a chosen
  interval with a minimum value of 5 minutes, so temporal scoring factors are uniformly high for
  this control, based on the assumption that thresholds are set to sensible values that detect
  suspicious values quickly and device-side metric publishing is not set to an unreasonably large
  interval. Detect metric names are identified in quotes throughout this mapping.
