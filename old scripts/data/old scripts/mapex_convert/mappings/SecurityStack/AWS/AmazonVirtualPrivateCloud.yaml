  Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a service that lets you launch AWS resources in a
  logically isolated virtual network that you define.  Amazon VPC provides advanced security
  features that allow you to perform inbound and outbound filtering at the instance and subnet
  level.  Amazon VPC also has monitoring features that let you perform functions like out-of-band
  monitoring and inline traffic inspection, which help you screen and secure traffic.

          that can protect against active scanning techniques such as Scanning IP Blocks and/or Vulnerability

          VPC security groups and network access control lists (NACLs) can provide significant protection for some variations
          of this technique, for example Port Knocking.  Other variations of this technique such as using traffic signaling
          to execute a malicious task is not easily mitigated by security groups or NACLs.  Consequently, its coverage score
          is Partial resulting in an overall Partial score.

              VPC security groups and network access control lists (NACLs) can protect against this sub-technique by
              enforcing limited access to only required ports.  Consequently, even if the adversary is able to utilize
              port knocking to open additional ports at the host level, it is still blocked at the security group or NACL

          VPC security groups and network access control lists (NACLs) can be used to restrict external network access to the

          channels.  In environments where unrestricted Internet access is required, security groups and NACLs can still be

          VPC Peering can also be utilized to route traffic privately between two VPCs which can reduce the Man-in-the-Middle
          attack surface.  VPC Endpoints can also similarly reduce the attack surface of Man-in-the-Middle attacks by ensuring
          network traffic between a VPC and supported AWS services are not exposed to the Internet.
