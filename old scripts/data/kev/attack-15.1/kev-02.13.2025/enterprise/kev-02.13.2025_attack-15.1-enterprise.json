The campaigns aimed to exploit this zero-day vulnerability, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's Zimbra session.\n\nThe attack involved two phases: an initial reconnaissance phase using emails with embedded remote images to track if targets opened the messages, and a second phase with spear-phishing emails containing malicious links.

It also includes a new DDoS botnet called RedGoBot, developed in Golang. The script uses wget and curl to download botnet clients for different processor architectures. RedGoBot can perform DDoS attacks on various protocols, including HTTP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, VSE, and OpenVPN, upon receiving commands from the threat operator. Additionally, injected commands can write binary payloads to files for execution or reboot the targeted server to cause denial of service.",

This stealthy attack vector does not require Internet Explorer as the default browser. Once the victim opens the document and disables protected view, the adversary executes arbitrary code by triggering a type confusion error in the JScript engine. This allows the adversary to deliver malicious payloads, conduct reconnaissance, and exfiltrate data, while erasing traces of the exploit by clearing the browser cache and history. The impact on the victim includes unauthorized access to sensitive information and the potential installation of backdoors for further exploitation.",
